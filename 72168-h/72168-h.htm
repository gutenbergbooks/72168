  <h2 class='c005'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This volume and volume <span class='fss'>XII.</span> contain those of Hazlitt’s writings which remained
uncollected during his lifetime and have not been included in earlier volumes of
the present edition. Some of these writings were published by the author’s son in
the three works of which particulars are given below; one of them, the essay
‘On Abstract Ideas,’ was published in the second edition (1836) of <cite>An Essay on the
Principles of Human Action</cite> (cf. Bibliographical Note, vol. <span class='fss'>VII.</span> p. 384); a few,
viz. ‘Common Places’ and ‘Trifles Light as Air,’ were included in Mr. W. C.
Hazlitt’s edition of <cite>The Round Table</cite> (Bohn’s Standard Library, 1871); but most of
the papers are here reprinted for the first time. See the Table of Contents, where
the essays which have never been republished before are marked by an asterisk.
The evidence upon which the Editors have relied in respect of this fresh material
will be found in the Notes. A great many of the Essays now printed have not
hitherto been identified as Hazlitt’s, but none have been included concerning
which the Editors feel any doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The works published by the author’s son and referred to above are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. ‘<cite>Literary Remains of the late William Hazlitt.</cite> With a Notice of his Life, By
his Son, and Thoughts on his Genius and Writings, By E. L. Bulwer, Esq., M.P.
and Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, M.P. In Two Volumes. London: Saunders and
Otley, Conduit Street. 1836.’ Vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> contained (as a frontispiece) Bewick’s
crayon drawing of Hazlitt reproduced in vol. <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> of the present edition; a Sonnet
‘written on seeing Bewick’s Chalk-Drawing of the Head of Hazlitt’ by Sheridan
Knowles; a ‘Biographical Sketch’ of Hazlitt by his son; ‘Some Thoughts on
the Genius of William Hazlitt’ signed ‘The Author of “Eugene Aram”‘;
‘Thoughts upon the Intellectual Character of the late William Hazlitt,’ by
Mr. Sergeant Talfourd, M.P.; ‘Character of Hazlitt,’ by Charles Lamb, extracted
from the well-known ‘Letter of Elia to Robert Southey, Esq.’ (1823); six
‘Sonnets to the Memory of Hazlitt’ by ‘A Lady’; and the following essays by
Hazlitt, viz.: (i) Project for a new Theory of Civil and Criminal Legislation, (ii)
Definition of Wit, (iii) On Means and Ends, (iv) Belief, whether Voluntary? (v)
Personal Politics, (vi) On the Writings of Hobbes, (vii) On Liberty and Necessity,
(viii) On Locke’s Essay on the Human Understanding, and (ix) On Tooke’s
Diversions of Purley.—Vol. <span class='fss'>II.</span> contained the following essays by Hazlitt, viz.: (i)
On Self-Love, (ii) On the Conduct of Life; or, Advice to a School-boy, (iii) On
the Fine Arts, (iv) The Fight, (v) On the Want of Money, (vi) On the Feeling of
Immortality in Youth, (vii) The Main-Chance, (viii) The Opera, (ix) Of Persons
One Would Wish to Have Seen, (x) My First Acquaintance with Poets, (xi) The
Shyness of Scholars, (xii) The Vatican, and (xiii) On the Spirit of Monarchy. Of
these, the essay ‘On the Fine Arts’ and the essay on ‘The Vatican’ are included
in vol. <span class='fss'>IX.</span> of the present edition; the rest are published in this volume or
in vol. <span class='fss'>XII.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>2. ‘<cite>Sketches and Essays.</cite> By William Hazlitt. Now first collected by his Son.
London: John Templeman, 248, Regent Street. <span class='fss'>MDCCCXXXIX.</span>’ An Advertisement
states that ‘The volume which the Editor has here the gratification of presenting
to the public, consists of Essays contributed by their author to various periodicals.
None of them have hitherto been published in a collective form, and it is confidently
anticipated that they will be received as an acceptable Companion to the
“Table Talk” and “Plain Speaker.”’ The contents are as follows: (i) On Reading
New Books, (ii) On Cant and Hypocrisy, (iii) Merry England, (iv) On a Sun-Dial,
(v) On Prejudice, (vi) Self-Love and Benevolence (a Dialogue), (vii) On
Disagreeable People, (viii) On Knowledge of the World, (ix) On Fashion, (x) On
Nicknames, (xi) On Taste, (xii) Why the Heroes of Romance are insipid, (xiii)
On the Conversation of Lords, (xiv) The Letter-Bell, (xv) Envy, (xvi) On the
Spirit of Partisanship, (xvii) Footmen, and (xviii) A Chapter on Editors. This
volume was reprinted in 1852 with ‘Sketches and Essays’ as a half-title and the
following title-page: ‘Men and Manners: Sketches and Essays. By William
Hazlitt. London: Published at the office of the Illustrated London Library,
227 Strand. <span class='fss'>MDCCCII.</span>’ In this edition the essay entitled ‘Self-Love and Benevolence
(A Dialogue)’ is omitted. A third edition (which has been reprinted from
time to time) was published in 1872 in Bohn’s Standard Library, edited by
Mr. W. C. Hazlitt.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. ‘<cite>Winterslow: Essays and Characters written there.</cite> By William Hazlitt.
Collected by his Son. London: David Bogue, Fleet Street. <span class='fss'>MDCCCL.</span>’ This
small 8vo volume contained the following essays: (i) My First Acquaintance with
Poets, (ii) Of Persons One Would Wish to Have Seen, (iii) Party Spirit, (iv) On the
Feeling of Immortality in Youth, (v) On Public Opinion, (vi) On Personal
Identity, (vii) Mind and Motive, (viii) On Means and Ends, (ix) Matter and
Manner, (x) On Consistency of Opinion, (xi) Project for a new Theory of Civil
and Criminal Legislation, (xii) On the Character of Burke, (xiii) On the Character
of Fox, (xiv) On the Character of Pitt, (xv) On the Character of Lord Chatham,
(xvi) Belief, whether Voluntary, and (xvii) A Farewell to Essay-Writing. This
volume was republished in 1872 along with <cite>Sketches and Essays</cite> in the volume of
Bohn’s Standard Library referred to above. Of the essays published in <cite>Winterslow</cite>
the Characters of Burke, Fox, Pitt and Lord Chatham are included in vol. <span class='fss'>III.</span> of
the present edition (<cite>Political Essays</cite>). The rest of the essays published in <cite>Sketches
and Essays</cite> and <cite>Winterslow</cite> are included in vols. <span class='fss'>XI.</span> and <span class='fss'>XII.</span> of the present edition.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen that <cite>Literary Remains</cite> and <cite>Winterslow</cite> to some extent overlap
one another, and that <cite>Winterslow</cite> contained several essays which had already been
published in <cite>Political Essays</cite>. Under these circumstances it has been found necessary
in the present edition to adopt a fresh scheme of arrangement in place of republishing
<cite>Literary Remains</cite>, <cite>Sketches and Essays</cite> and <cite>Winterslow</cite> as they stand. Each
essay, whether contained in one of those posthumous collections or now republished
for the first time, is printed in chronological order under the heading of the
magazine or newspaper in which it originally appeared; and the magazines themselves
are arranged in a chronological order based upon the respective dates at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>which Hazlitt began to contribute to them. The only exception to this last
scheme of arrangement is that at the end of the present volume it was found convenient
to take the ‘Common Places’ from <cite>The Literary Examiner</cite> a little before
their turn. They should strictly have followed the contributions to <cite>The Liberal</cite>
in vol. <span class='fss'>XII.</span>, but it was thought better not to divide between two volumes the
important essays from <cite>The New Monthly Magazine</cite> which now begin vol. <span class='fss'>XII.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>This plan of arrangement seemed on the whole the simplest and best, and it is
hoped that with the aid of the Tables of Contents and the Index the reader will
have no difficulty in finding any particular essay.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the present edition all the essays, the magazine source of which is known,
have been printed <i><span lang="la">verbatim</span></i> from the magazines themselves. In preparing <cite>Literary
Remains</cite>, <cite>Sketches and Essays</cite> and <cite>Winterslow</cite> for the press the author’s son took
considerable liberties with the text. In one or two cases the alterations which he
made may have been based on a <span class='fss'>MS.</span> or a copy of a magazine with corrections by
Hazlitt, but far more often the essays were reprinted with omissions and trifling
alterations made, as it would seem, by the editor himself on his own responsibility.
Some passages thus omitted and now restored for the first time are of great interest.
The more important of them are specially indicated in the notes. In the few
cases where the author’s son added passages from a MS. or other authoritative source,
the passages have been given either in the text (with a note indicating where they
occur), or in the Notes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the essays printed in the text of this volume and to those referred
to in the notes it may be convenient to mention here a few essays which may have
been written by Hazlitt but have been omitted from the present edition on the
ground that his authorship is not sufficiently certain. They are arranged in the
following list under the heading of the magazine in which they first appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. <cite>The Examiner.</cite></p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>A review (Sept. 29 and Oct. 13, 1816) of George Ensor’s <cite>On the State of Europe in 
    January, 1816</cite>. This work of George Ensor’s (1769–1843), ‘full,’ as the reviewer 
    says, ‘of undeniable facts, and undeniable inferences from them,’ was likely to appeal to 
    Hazlitt’s political sympathies. The review consists mainly of extracts from the work 
    itself, but what there is of comment is certainly very much in Hazlitt’s vein.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>‘A Modern Tory Delineated’ (Oct. 6). This paper, which is dated from Gloucester, Oct. 1, 
    1816, has certainly a very strong flavour of Hazlitt.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Some political leaders and articles which appeared at the beginning of 1817 and are not 
    signed with Leigh Hunt’s mark. The most important of these are: ‘Mr. Pitt—Finance, 
    Sinking Fund’ (Jan. 19); ‘Defence of National Debt’ (Jan. 26); ‘Progress of Finance’ 
    (Feb. 16); and ‘Friends of Revolution’ (Feb. 23).

<p class='c008'>Three papers on the criminal law, viz.: ‘Historical View of the Progress
of Opinion on the Criminal Law and the Punishment of Death’ (March,
1819, vol. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 195); ‘Parliamentary Report on the Criminal Laws’
(Dec., 1819, vol. <span class='fss'>V.</span> p. 491); and a short paper on the same subject
(Jan. 1820, vol. <span class='fss'>VI.</span> p. 26). Mr. W. C. Hazlitt in his <cite>Memoirs, etc.</cite>
(vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. xxvi.) attributes these articles to Hazlitt, perhaps on the
strength of some <span class='fss'>MS.</span> or proof in his possession at the date of the
<cite>Memoirs</cite> (1867). Hazlitt’s authorship, however, though very probable,
does not seem to be certain, and as the papers consist largely of
extracts from a Parliamentary Report, they have been omitted from
the present edition. Hazlitt’s views on capital punishment will be
found in an extract which was first published in <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite> in
1831 and is reprinted in vol. <span class='fss'>XII.</span></p>

  <h2 class='c014'>ON ABSTRACT IDEAS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I shall in this essay state Mr. Locke’s account of generalization, abstraction,
and reasoning, as contrasted with the modern one, and then
endeavour to defend the existence of these faculties, or acts of the
mind from the objections urged against them by Hume, Berkeley,
Condillac, and others, which are in truth merely repetitions of what
Hobbes has said on the subject. I must premise, however, that I do
not think it possible ever to arrive at a demonstration of generals or
abstractions by beginning in Mr. Locke’s method with particular
ones: this faculty of abstraction is by most considered as a sort of
artificial refinement upon our other ideas, as an excrescence, no ways
contained in the common impressions of things, nor scarcely necessary
to the common purposes of life, and it is by Mr. Locke altogether
denied to be among the faculties of brutes. It is the ornament and
top-addition of the mind of man, which proceeding from simple
sensations upwards, is gradually sublimed into the abstract notions of
things; ‘from the root springs lighter the green stalk, from thence
the leaves more airy, last the bright consummate flower.’ On the
other hand, I conceive that all our notions from first to last, are strictly
speaking, general and abstract, not absolute and particular; and
that to have a perfectly distinct idea of any one individual thing,
or concrete existence, either as to the parts of which it is composed,
or the differences belonging to it, or the circumstances connected with
it, would imply an unlimited power of comprehension in the human
mind, which is impossible. All particular things consist of, and lead
to an infinite number of other things. Abstraction is a consequence
of the limitation of the comprehensive faculty, and mixes itself more or
less with every act of the mind of whatever kind, and in every
moment of its existence. There is no idea of an individual object,
which consists of a single impression, but of a number of impressions
massed together: there is no idea of a particular quality of an object,
which is perfectly simple, or which is not the result of a number of
impressions of the same sort classed together by the mind without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>attending to their particular differences. Every idea of an object is,
therefore, in a strict sense an imperfect and general notion of an
aggregate: of a house, or tree, as well as of a city, or forest: of a grain
of sand as well as of the universe. Every idea of a sensible quality,
as of the whiteness of the sheet of paper before me, or the hardness
of the table on which I lean, implies the same power of generalization,
of connecting several impressions into one sort, as the most refined
and abstract idea of virtue and justice, of motion, or extension, or
space of time, or being itself. This view of the subject is not, I confess,
very obvious at first sight, and it will be more easily understood
after I have stated the arguments of others on this difficult question.
The concise account of the nature of abstract ideas is that which Mr.
Locke has given, as follows. ‘All things that exist being particular,
it may be perhaps thought reasonable that words which ought
to be conformed to things should be so too, I mean in their signification:
but yet we find quite the contrary. The far greatest part of words
that make all languages are general terms, which has not been the
effect of neglect or chance, but of reason and necessity.’ ‘First, it is
impossible that every particular thing should have a distinct peculiar
name. For the signification and use of words depending on that
connection which the mind makes between its ideas and the sounds it
uses as signs of them, it is necessary in the applications of names to
things, that the mind should have distinct ideas of the things, and retain
also the particular name that belongs to every one, with its peculiar
appropriation to that idea. But it is beyond the power of human
capacity to frame and retain distinct ideas of all the particular things
we meet with; every bird and beast we see, every tree and plant that
affect the senses, could not find a place in the most capacious understanding.
If it be looked on as an instance of a prodigious memory,
that some generals have been able to call every soldier in their army
by his proper name, we may easily find a reason why men never
attempted to give names to each sheep in their flock, or crow that flies
over their heads, much less to call every leaf of plants or grain of sand
that came in their way, by a peculiar name. Secondly, if it were
possible, it would not serve to the chief end of language. Men would
not in vain heap up names of particular things that would not serve
them to communicate their thoughts. Men learn names, and use
them in talk with others, only that they may be understood, which is
then only done, when by use or consent, the sound I make by the
organs of speech, excites in another man’s mind who hears it, the idea
I apply to it in mine when I speak it. This cannot be done by names
applied to particular things, whereof I alone have the ideas in my
mind, the names of them could not be significant, intelligible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>another who was not acquainted with all those very particular
things which had fallen under my notice. Thirdly, granting this
feasible, which I think it is not, yet a distinct name of every
particular thing would not be of any great use for the improvement
of knowledge; which though founded in particular things, enlarges
itself by general views, to which things reduced into sorts under
general names are properly subservient. These with the names belonging
to them come within some compass, and do not multiply every
moment beyond what either the mind can contain, or use requires, and
therefore in these men have for the most part stopped. But yet not
so, as to hinder themselves from distinguishing particular things by
appropriated names, where convenience demands it. And therefore
in their own species, which they have to do with, and wherein they
have often occasion to mention particular persons, they make use of
proper names; and these distinct individuals have distinct denominations.
Besides persons, countries, cities, rivers, mountains, and other
like distinctions of place have usually found particular names, and that
for the same reason; and I doubt not but if we had reason to mention
particular horses, as often as we have to mention particular men, we
should have proper names for the one as familiarly as for the other,
and Bucephalus would be a word as much in use as Alexander. And
therefore we see amongst jockies, horses have their proper names to be
known and distinguished by, as commonly as their servants, because
amongst them there is often occasion to mention this or that particular
horse, when he is out of sight. The next thing to be considered is how
general words came to be made. For since all things that exist are
only particulars, how come we by general terms, or where find we those
general natures they are supposed to stand for? Words become general
by being made the signs of general ideas, and ideas become general by
separating from them the circumstances of time and place, and any
other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence.
By this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more
individuals than one, each of which having in it a conformity to that
abstract idea is (as we call it) of that sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But to deduce this a little more distinctly, it will not, perhaps, be
amiss to trace our notions and names from their beginning, and
observe by what degrees we proceed, and by what steps we enlarge
our ideas from their first infancy. There is nothing more evident
than that the ideas of the persons children converse with, are like the
persons themselves, only particulars. The ideas of the nurse and the
mother are well framed in the mind and like pictures of them there,
represent only those individuals. The names they first give rise to are
confined to these individuals, and the names of <em>nurse</em> and <em>mamma</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>which the child uses, determine themselves to those persons. Afterwards
when time and a larger acquaintance has made them observe
that there are a great many other things in the world, that in some
common agreements of shape, and several other properties resemble
their father and mother, and those persons they have been used to,
they frame an idea which they find those many particulars do partake
in, and to that they give with others the name <em>Man</em>, for example.
And thus they come to have a general name, and a general idea.
Wherein they make nothing new, but only leave out of the complex
idea they had of Peter and James, Mary and Jane, that which is
peculiar to each, and retain what is common to them all. By the
same way that they come by the general name and idea of man, they
easily advance to more general names and notions. For observing that
several things that differ from their idea of man, and therefore cannot
be comprehended under that name, have yet certain qualities wherein
they agree with man, by retaining only those qualities and uniting them
into one idea, they have again another and more general idea; to
which having given a name, they make a term of a more comprehensive
extension; which new idea is made, not by any new addition,
but only as before, by leaving out the shape, and some other properties
signified by the name man, and retaining only a body with life, sense,
and spontaneous motion, comprehended under the name <em>animal</em>. That
this is the way that men first formed general ideas and general names
to them, I think is so evident that there needs no other proof of it,
but the considering of a man’s self or others, and the ordinary
proceedings of their mind in knowledge: and he that thinks general
natures or notions are anything else but <em>such abstracts and partial ideas
of more complex ones taken at first from particular existencies</em>, will I fear
be at a loss where to find them. For let any one reflect and then
tell me, wherein does his idea of <em>man</em> differ from that of Paul and
Peter, or his idea of horse from that of Bucephalus, but in the leaving
out something that is peculiar to each individual; and retaining so
much of those particular complex ideas of several particular existencies,
as they are found to agree in? Of the complex ideas signified by the
names <em>man</em> and <em>horse</em>, leaving out those particulars wherein they differ,
and retaining only those wherein they agree, and of those making a
new distinct complex idea and giving the name <em>animal</em> to it, one has a
more general term that comprehends with man several other creatures.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Leave out of the idea of animal sense and spontaneous motion, and
the remaining complex idea, made up of the remaining simple ones
of body, life, and nourishment, becomes a more general one under
the more comprehensive word <i><span lang="la">vivens</span></i>. And not to dwell upon these
particular, so evident in itself, by the same way the mind proceeds to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span><em>body</em>, <em>substance</em>, and at last to <em>being</em>, thing, and such universal terms,
which stand for any of our ideas whatsoever. To conclude: this
whole mystery of genera and species, which make such a noise in the
schools, and are with justice so little regarded out of them, is nothing
else but abstract ideas, more or less comprehensive, with names annexed
to them. In all which this is constant and invariable, that every
more general term stands for such an idea as is but a part of any of
those contained under it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The author adds, ‘It is plain by what has been said, that general
and universal belong not only to the real existence of things, but are
the inventions and creatures of the understanding, made by it, for its
own use, and concern only signs, whether words or ideas. Words
are general, when used for signs of general ideas, and so are applicable
indifferently to many particular things; and ideas are general when
they are set up as the representatives of many particular things, but
universality belongs not to things themselves, which are all of them
particular in their existence, even those words and ideas which in
their significations are general. When, therefore, we quit particulars,
the generals that rest are only creatures of our own making, their
general nature being nothing but the capacity they are put in to of
signifying many particulars. For the signification they have is nothing
but a relation, that by the mind of man is added to them.’ See p. 15,
vol. 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke at first here evidently supposes that we have ideas
answering to general terms, i.e. certain ideas of such particulars as a
number of things are found to agree in, or that there are some common
qualities by retaining which and only leaving out what is peculiar and
foreign, without adding anything new, we get at the general notion.
He afterwards to all appearance reduces these general notions to mere
signs or sounds with which several particular ideas are associated, but
which do not correspond to any common properties or general nature
really inhering in these particular things. In the same manner he
continues to take different sides of the question, when he comes to
treat of genera, and species, when his antipathy to the word <em>essence</em>
constantly drives him back into the notion that all our ideas of essences
are mere terms, and the want of solidity in that opinion again as
constantly disposes him to admit a real difference in the sorts of
things, besides the difference of the names we give to them. For
immediately after affirming that the abstract essences of things are the
workmanship of the understanding, he adds, ‘I would not here be
thought to forget, much less to deny, that nature, in the production of
things makes several of them alike: there is nothing more obvious,
especially in the races of animals, and all things propagated by seed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>But yet, I think we may say, the sorting of them by names is the
workmanship of the understanding taking occasion from the similitude
it observes amongst them to make abstract general ideas, and set them
up as patterns in forms (for in that sense the word form has a very
proper signification), to which as particular things existing are found
to agree, so they come to be of that species, have that denomination,
or are put into that class. For when we say this is a <em>man</em>, that a
<em>horse</em>, &#38;c. what do we else but rank things under different specific
names, as agreeing to those abstract ideas, of which we have made
these names the signs? And what are the essences of those species
set out and marked by names, but those abstract ideas in the mind,
which are as it were the bonds between particular things that exist,’
&#38;c. For my own part I must confess that I agree with the Bishop
of Worcester on this occasion, who asks, ‘What is it that makes
Peter, James, and John real men? Is it the attributing the general
name to them? No, certainly, but that the true and real essence of
a man is in every one of them. They take their denomination of being
men from that common nature or essence which is in them.’ On the
opposite system it is not the nature of the thing which determines the
imposition of the name, but the imposition of the name which determines
the nature of the thing; or giving them the name makes Peter,
James, and John men, as in the opinion of some divines Baptism makes
them Christians. That there is a real difference in things and ideas,
answering to their general names, appears evident from this single
observation, that if it were not so, we could never know how to apply
these general names, and we could no more distinguish between a man
and a horse than we could tell at first sight, that one man’s proper
name was John and another’s Thomas. The puzzle about genera
and species, in this view of the question, seems to arise from a very
obvious transposition of ideas. Because the abstracting or separating
these general ideas from particular circumstances is the workmanship
of the understanding: it has, therefore, been inferred, that the ideas
themselves are so too, and that they exist no where but in the mind
which perceives them.</p>

<p class='c007'>But I would fain ask, in the account which Mr. Locke gives of
the abstract ideas of <em>animal</em> for example, whether body, sense, and
motion, as they exist in different individuals, have not a general nature,
or something common in all those individuals. If <em>body</em> in one case
expresses the same thing, or same idea as <em>body</em> in another, their
generals belong to things and ideas, as well as to names; if body in
one case expresses quite a different thing in one to what it does in
another, then it is not easy to imagine what determines the mind to
apply the name to these different things, or on what foundation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Mr. Locke’s definition rests. Extreme opinions were not in general
the side on which Mr. Locke erred; and, on the present occasion,
he has qualified his opposition to the prevailing system in such a
manner, that it is difficult to say in what point he admitted or rejected
it. He evidently, in the general scope of this argument, admits the
reality of abstract ideas in the mind, though he denies the existence
of real sorts, or nature of things of the mind to correspond to them:
for the expressions which intimate any doubt of the former are
occasional and parenthetical, and his acknowledgment that there is
something in nature which guides and determines the mind in the
sorting of things and giving names to them is equally extorted from
him. There is none of this doubt and perplexity in the minds of his
French commentators; none of this suspicion of error and anxious
desire to correct it; no lurking objections arise to stagger their
confidence in themselves; it is all the same light airy self-complacency;
not a speck is to be seen in the clear sky of their metaphysics, not a
cloud obscures the sparkling current of their thoughts. In the logic
of Condillac, the whole question of abstract ideas, of genera and
species, and of the nature of reasoning as founded upon them, is settled
and cleared from all difficulties, past, present, and to come, with as
little expence of thought, time, and trouble, as possible. The Abbé
demonstrates with ease. ‘General ideas,’ he says, ‘of which we have
explained the formation, are a part of the aggregate idea of each of
the individuals to which they correspond, and they are considered,
for this reason, as so many partial or imperfect ideas. The idea of
man, for instance, makes part of the complex ideas of Peter and Paul,
since it is equally to be found in both. There is no such thing as
man in general. This partial idea has then no reality out of the
mind, but it has one in the mind, where it exists separately from the
aggregate or individual ideas of which it is a part. All our general
ideas are then so many abstract ideas, and you see that we form them
only in consequence of taking from each individual idea that which
is common to all.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But what, in truth, is the reality which a general and abstract idea
has in the mind. It is nothing but a name: or, if it is any thing
more, it necessarily ceases to be abstract, and general. When, for
example, I think of a <em>man</em>, I consider this word as a common
denomination, in which case, it is very evident, that my idea is in
some sort circumscribed within this name, that it does not extend to
anything beyond it, and that consequently it is nothing but the name
itself. If, on the contrary, thinking of man in general, I contemplate
any thing in this word, besides the mere denomination, it can only be
by representing myself to some one man; and a man can no more be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>man in general, or in the abstract in my mind, than in nature.
Abstract ideas are therefore only denominations. If we will absolutely
think that they are something else, we shall only resemble a painter
who should obstinately persist in painting the figure of a man in
general, and who would still paint only individuals. This observation
concerning abstract and general ideas, demonstrates that their clearness
depends entirely on the order in which we have arranged the denominations
of classes; and that, consequently, to determine this sort of
ideas, there is only one means, which is to construct a language
properly.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘This confirms what we have already demonstrated, how necessary
words are to us: for if we had no general terms, we should have no
abstract ideas, we should have neither <em>genera</em>, or <em>species</em>, and without
<em>genera</em> and <em>species</em>, we could reason upon nothing. But if we reason
only by means of words this is a new proof that we can only reason
well or ill, according as the language, in which we reason, is well or
ill made. The analysis of our thoughts can only enable us to reason
in proportion as by instructing us how to class our abstract ideas, it
enables us how to form our language correctly, and the whole art of
reasoning is thus reduced to the art of well speaking.’</p>

<p class='c007'>What in this supremacy of words is to be the criterion of well
speaking the Abbé does not say.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘To speak, to reason, to form general or abstract ideas, are then in
fact the same thing: and this truth, simple as it is, might pass for a
discovery. Certainly, men in general have not had any notion of it;
this is evident from the manner in which they speak and reason; it is
evident from the abuse which they make of abstract ideas; finally, it
is evident from the difficulties which those persons confessedly find
in conceiving of abstract ideas who have so little in speaking of
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The art of reasoning resolves into the construction of languages,
only because the order of our ideas itself depends entirely on the
subordination that subsists between the names given to <em>genera</em> and
<em>species</em>; and as we arrive at new ideas only by forming new classes, it
follows that we can only determine or define our ideas by determining
their classes. In this case we should reason well, because we should
be guided by analogy in our conclusions as well as in the acceptation
of words.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Convinced, therefore, that classes or sorts of things are pure
denominations, we shall never think of supposing that there exist in
nature <em>genera</em> or <em>species</em>; and we shall understand by these words
nothing but a certain mode of classing things according to the relations
which they have to ourselves and to one another. We shall be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>sensible that we can only discover those relations, and not what the
things truly are.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Berkeley handled his subjects with little tenderness, and he has
perfectly anatomised this subject of abstract ideas. In choosing to
answer the objections to this doctrine as stated by him, I shall not
be accused of wishing to encounter a mean adversary. I can only
trust to the goodness of my cause. I hope I shall be excused for
going at some length into the argument, because it is one of the most
difficult and complicated in itself, and is of the most extensive application
to other questions relating to the human understanding. If we
can come to any satisfactory issue to it, it will be worth the pains of
enquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘It is agreed on all hands,’ says this author, ‘that the quantities or
modes of things do never really exist in each of them, apart by itself,
and separated from all others, but are mixed, as it were, and blended
together, several in the same object. But we are told the mind being
able to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from those other
qualities with which it is united, does by that means frame to itself
abstract ideas. For example, there is perceived by sight, an object,
extended, coloured, and moved. This mixed idea the mind resolving
into its simple constituent parts, and viewing each by itself exclusive
of the rest, does frame the abstract ideas of extension, colour, and
motion. Not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without
extension, but only that the mind can frame to itself by abstraction
the idea of colour, exclusive of extension, and of motion exclusive
both of colour and extension. Again, the mind having observed that
in the particular extensions perceived by sense, there is something
common and alike in all, and some other things peculiar, as this or
that figure, or magnitude, which distinguish them one from another, it
considers apart, or singles out by itself that which is most common,
making thereof a most abstract idea of extension, line, surface, or
solid, nor has any figure or magnitude, but is an idea prescinded from
all these. So likewise the mind by leaving out of the particular
colours perceived by sense, that which distinguishes them one from
another, and retaining that which only is common to all, makes an
idea of colour in abstract, which is neither red, nor blue, not white,
&#38;c. And in like manner by considering motion abstractedly, not
only the body moved, but likewise from the figure it describes, and
all particular directions and velocities, the abstract idea of motion is
framed, which equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever
that may be perceived by sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘And as the mind frames to itself abstract ideas of qualities, or
modes, so does it by the precision or mental separation, attain abstract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>ideas of the more compound beings, which include several co-existent
qualities:—for example, the mind having observed, that Peter, James,
John, &#38;c., resemble each other in certain common agreements of
shape, and other qualities, leaves out of the complex or compounded
idea it has of Peter, James, &#38;c., that which is peculiar to each, retaining
only what is common to all; and so makes an abstract idea
wherein the particulars equally partake, abstracting entirely, and
cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might determine
it, to any particular existence. And after this manner it is said,
we come by the abstract idea of man, or if you please humanity, or
human nature; ’tis true, there is included colour, because there is
no man but has some colour, but then it can be neither white nor
black, nor any particular colour, because there is no one particular
colour, wherein all men partake; so there is included stature, but then
it is neither tall stature, nor low stature, nor yet middle stature, but
something abstracted from all these; and so of the rest. Moreover,
there being a great variety of other creatures that partake in some
parts, not all, of the complex idea, man, the mind leaving out those
parts which are peculiar to men, and retaining those only which are
common to all living creatures, frames the idea of animals, which
abstracts not only from all particular men, but also, all birds, beasts,
fishes, and insects. By <em>Body</em> is meant body without any particular
shape, or figure, there being no one shape or figure common to all
animals, without covering of hair, feathers, or scales, &#38;c. nor yet
naked; hair, feathers, scales, and nakedness, being the distinguishing
properties of particular animals, and for that reason left out of the
abstract idea; upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be
neither in walking, nor flying, nor creeping, it is nevertheless a motion,
but what that motion is, it is not easy to conceive.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their
ideas, they best can tell: for myself I dare be confident I have it not.
I have a faculty of imagining or representing to myself the ideas of
those particular things I have perceived, and of variously compounding
and dividing them. I can imagine a man with two heads or the
upper part of a man joined to the body of a horse; I can consider
the hand, the eye, the nose, each by itself, abstracted or separated
from the rest of the body. But then, whatever hand or eye, I
imagine, it must have some particular shape, and colour. Likewise,
the idea of man that I frame to myself must be either of a white, or
a black, or a tawny; a strait, or a crooked; a tall, or a low, or a
middle-sized man. I cannot by any effort of thought conceive the
abstract idea above-described: and it is equally impossible for me to
form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>which is neither swift nor slow, curvilinear nor rectilinear, and the
like may be said of other abstract general ideas whatsoever: to be
plain, I own myself able to abstract in one sense, as when I consider
some particular parts or qualities separated from others, with which,
though they are united in some objects, yet it is possible they may
really exist without them. But I deny that I can abstract from one
another, or conceive separately those qualities, which it is impossible
should exist so separated:—or that I can frame a general notion by
abstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid, which two last
are the proper acceptation of abstraction; and there is ground to think
most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The generality of men, which are simple and illiterate, never pretend
to abstract notions. It is said they are difficult and not to be
attained without pains and study; we may therefore reasonably conclude
that, if such there be, they are confined only to the learned. I
proceed to examine what can be alleged in defence of the doctrine of
abstraction, and try if I can discover what it is that inclines the man
of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense
as that seems to be. There has been a late excellent and deservedly
esteemed philosopher, who no doubt has given it very much, by seeming
to think the having abstract general ideas is what puts the difference
in point of understanding betwixt man and beast.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The author here quotes a passage from Mr. Locke on the subject,
which it is not necessary to give, and afterwards his opinion that
words become general by being made signs of general ideas. He
then proceeds:—‘To this I cannot assent, being of opinion that a word
becomes general by being made the sign, not of an abstract general
idea, but of several particular ideas, any one of which it indifferently
suggests to the mind.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘If we will annex a meaning to our words and speak only of what
we can only conceive, I believe we shall acknowledge that an idea,
which considered in itself is particular, becomes general, by being
made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas <em>of the same
sort</em>. To make this plain by example, suppose a geometrician is
demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts. He
draws for instance a black line of an inch in length: this which is in
itself a particular line, is nevertheless, with regard to its signification,
general, since, as it is there used, it represents all particular lines
whatsoever, so that what is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all
lines, or in other words of a line in general; and, as that particular
line becomes general, by being made a sign, so the name <em>line</em>, which
taken absolutely, is particular, by being a sign, is made general. And
as the former owes its generality not to its being the sign of an abstract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>or general line, but of all particular right lines that may possibly
exist, so the latter must be thought to derive its generality from the
same cause, namely, the various particular lines which it indifferently
denotes.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘To give the reader a clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas,
and the uses they are thought necessary to, I shall add one more
passage out of the Essay on Human Understanding, which is as
follows:—“Abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children, or
the yet unexercised mind as particular ones. If they seem so to
grown men, it is only by constant and familiar use they are made so.
For when we nicely reflect upon them, we shall find that general
ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind, that carry difficulty
with them, and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to
imagine. For example, does it not require some skill and pains to
form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the abstract,
comprehensive, and difficult), for it must be neither oblique nor
rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none
of these at once. In effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist,
an idea wherein some parts of different and inconsistent ideas are put
together. ’Tis true the mind in this imperfect state has need of such
ideas, and makes all the haste it can to them, for the convenience of
communication and enlargement of knowledge, to both of which it is
naturally very much inclined. But yet one has reason to suspect such
ideas are marks of our imperfections, at least this is enough to show
that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is
first and most easily acquainted with, nor such as its earliest knowledge
is conversant about.”‘—After laughing at this description of the
general idea of a triangle, which is neither oblique nor rectangle,
equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once,
Berkeley adds, ‘much is here said of the difficulty that abstract ideas
carry with them, and the pains and skill requisite to the forming of
them. And it is on all hands agreed that there is need of great toil
and labour of mind, to emancipate our thoughts from particular
objects, and raise them to those sublime speculations that are conversant
about abstract ideas. From all which the natural consequences
should seem to be, that so difficult a thing as forming abstract ideas
was not necessary for communication, which is so familiar to all sorts
of men. But, we are told, if they seem obvious and easy to grown
men, it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so.
Now I would fain know at what time it is, men are employed in surmounting
that difficulty and furnishing themselves with those necessary
helps for discourse. It cannot be when they are grown up, for then
it seems they are not conscious of any such pains-taking; it therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>remains to be the business of their childhood. And surely the great
and multiplied labour of framing abstract notions will be found a hard
task for that tender age. Is it not a hard thing to imagine that a
couple of children cannot prate of their sugar plums, and rattles, and
the rest of their little trinkets, till they have first packed together
numberless inconsistencies, and so framed in their minds general
abstract ideas, and annexed them to every common name they make
use of.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘It is I know a point much insisted on that all knowledge and
demonstration are about universal notions, to which I fully assent.
But then it does not appear to me that those notions are formed by
abstraction, in the manner premised; universality, so far as I can
comprehend, not consisting in the absolute, positive nature and conception
of any thing, but in the relation it bears to the particulars
signified, or represented by it. But here it will be demanded, how
we can know any proposition to be true of all particular triangles,
except we have seen it first demonstrated of the abstract idea of a
triangle which equally agrees to all?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘For because a property may be demonstrated to agree to some
particular triangle, it will not thence follow that it equally belongs to
every other with it. For example, having demonstrated that the
three angles of an isosceles, rectangular triangle, are equal to two
right ones, I cannot therefore conclude this affection argues to all
other triangles, which have neither a right angle, nor two equal sides.
It seems, therefore, that to be certain this proposition is universally
true we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular
triangle, which is impossible, or once for all demonstrate it of
the abstract idea of a triangle, in which all the particulars do indifferently
partake, and by which they are all equally represented.’ To
which I answer, that though the idea I have in view, whilst I make
the demonstration, be, for instance, that of an isosceles, not a regular
triangle, whose sides are of a determinate length, I may nevertheless
be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or
bigness soever. And that neither because the right angle, nor the
equality, nor determinate length of the sides are at all concerned in
the demonstration. It is true, the diagram I have in view includes
all these particulars, but then there is not the least mention made of
them in the proofs of the proposition. It is not said the three angles
are equal to two right ones, because one of these is a right angle, or
because the sides comprehending it are of the same length. Which
sufficiently shews that the right angle might have been oblique and
the sides unequal, and for all the others the demonstrations have held
good. And for this reason it is that I conclude that to be true of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>any oblique angular, or scalenon, which I had demonstrated of a particular
right angled, equicrural, triangle, and not because I demonstrated
the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle.’ The author
then adds some further remarks on the use of abstract terms, and concludes—‘May
we not, for example, be affected with the promise of
a <em>good thing</em>, though we have not an idea of what it is? or is not the
being threatened with danger sufficient to excite a dread, though we
think not of a particular evil likely to befal us, and yet frame to ourselves
an idea of danger in abstract?’ Introduction to Principles of
Human Knowledge, p. 31.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hume, who has taken up Berkeley’s arguments on this subject,
and affirms that the doctrine of abstract ideas applies the flattest of all
contradictions, that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to
be, has enlarged a good deal on this last topic of the manner in which
words may be supposed to excite general ideas. His words are these:
‘Where we have found a resemblance between any two objects that
often occur to us, we apply the same name to all of them, whatever
differences we may observe in the degrees of their quantity and
quality, and whatever differences may appear among them. After
we have acquired a custom of this kind, the hearing of that name
revives the idea of one of these objects, and makes the imagination
conceive it with its particular circumstances and proportions. But as
the same word is supposed to have been frequently applied to other
individuals that are different in many respects from the idea which is
immediately present to the mind, the word not being able to revive
the idea of all these individuals, only <em>touches</em> the soul, if I may be
allowed so to speak, and revives that custom, which we have acquired
by surveying them. They are not in reality present to the mind, but
only in power, nor do we draw them out distinctly in the imagination,
but keep ourselves in readiness to survey any of them, as we may be
prompted by a present design or necessity. The word raises up an
individual idea, along with a certain custom; and that custom produces
any other individual one, for which we may have occasion.’
Treatise of Human Nature, p. 43, 4. The author afterwards adds,
with his usual candour, that this account does not perfectly satisfy
him, but he relies principally on the logical demonstration of the
impossibilities of abstract ideas just before given.</p>

<p class='c007'>I confess it does not seem an easy matter to recover the argument
in this state of it; however, I will attempt it. What I shall
endeavour will not be so much to answer the foregoing reasoning as
to prove that in a strict sense all ideas whatever are mere abstractions
and can be nothing else; that some of the most clear, distinct, and
positive ideas of particular objects are made up of numberless inconsistencies;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and that as Hume expresses it, they do touch the soul,
and are not drawn distinctly in the imagination, &#38;c. Though I shall
not be able to point out distinctly the fallacy of the foregoing reasonings,
I hope to make it appear that there must be something wrong in
the premises, and that the nature of thought and ideas is quite different
from what is here supposed. I may be allowed to set off one paradox
against another, and as these writers affirm that all abstract ideas are
particular images, so I shall try to prove that all particular images are
abstract ideas. If it can be made to appear that our ideas of particular
things themselves are not particular, it may be easily granted
that those which are in general allowed to be abstract are all so. The
existence of abstract and complex ideas in the mind has been disputed
for the same reason, that is, in falsely attributing individuality, or
absolute unity to the objects of sense. While each thing or object
was said to be absolutely one and simple, there was found to be no
reach, compass, or expansion of mind, to comprehend it; and, on the
other hand, there was no room on the same supposition for the doctrine
of abstraction, for there is no abstracting from absolute unity.
That which is one positive, indivisible thing, must remain entire as
this, or cease to exist. There is no alternative between individuality
and nothing. As long as we are determined to consider any one
thing or idea, as the knot of a chain, or the figure of a man, or any
thing else, as one individual, it must, as it were, go together: we can
take nothing away without destroying it altogether. I have already
shewn that there is no one object which does not consist of a number
of parts and relations, or which does not require a comprehensive
facility in the mind in order to conceive of it. Now abstraction is a
necessary consequence of the limitation of this power of the mind,
and if it were a previous condition of our having the ideas of things
that we should comprehend distinctly all the particulars of which
they are composed, we could have no ideas at all. An imperfectly
comprehended is a general idea. But the mind perfectly comprehends
the whole of no one object. That is, it has not an absolute and
distinct knowledge of all its parts or differences, and consequently all
our ideas are abstractions, that is a general and confused result from
a number of undistinguished, and undistinguishable impressions, for
there is no possible medium between a perfectly distinct comprehension
of all the particulars, which is impossible, or that imperfect and
confused one, that properly constitutes a general notion in the one
case or the other. To explain this more particularly. In looking
at any object, as a house on the opposite side of the way, it is supposed
that the impression I have of it is a perfectly distinct, precise,
or definite idea, in which abstraction has no concern. And the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>general idea of a house, it is said, is rather a mere word, or must
reduce itself to some such positive, individual image as that conveyed
by the sight of a particular house, it being impossible that it should
be made up of the confused, imperfect, and undistinguishable impressions
of several different objects of the same kind. Now it appears
to me the easiest thing in the world to shew that this sensible image
of a particular house, into which the general is to be resolved for
greater clearness, is itself but a confused and vague notion, or numberless
inconsistencies packed together; not one precise individual
thing, or any number of things, distinctly perceived. For I would
ask of any one who thinks his senses furnish him with these infallible
and perfect conceptions of things, free from all contradiction and perplexity,
whether he has a precise knowledge of all the circumstance
of the object prescribed to him. For instance, is the knowledge
which he has that the house before him is larger than another near it,
in consequence of his intentively considering all the bricks of which
it is composed, or can he tell that it contains a greater number of
windows than another, without distinctly counting them? Let us
suppose, however, that he does. But this will not be enough unless
he has also a distinct perception of the numbers and the size of the
panes of glass in each window, or of any mark, stain, or dirt in each
separate brick? Otherwise his idea of each of these particulars will
still be general, and his most substantial knowledge built on shadows;
that is composed of a number of parts of the parts of which he has no
knowledge. If objects were what mankind in general suppose them,
single things, we could have no notion of them but what was particular,
for by leaving out any thing we should leave out the whole
object, which is but one thing. We may also be said to have a
particular knowledge of things in proportion to the number of parts
we distinguish in them. But the real foundation of all our knowledge,
is and must be general, that is, a mere confused impression or effect of
feeling produced by a number of things, for there is no object which
does not consist of an infinite number of parts, and we have not an
infinite number of distinct ideas answering to them. Yet it cannot
be denied that we have some knowledge of things, that they make
some impression on us, and this knowledge, this impression, must
therefore be an abstract one, the natural result of a limited understanding,
which is variously affected by a number of things at the
same time, but which is not susceptible of itself to an infinite number
of modifications. If it should be said that the sensible image of the
house is still one, as being one impression, or given result, I answer
that the most abstract ideas of a house, and the imperfect recollection
of a number of houses is in the same sense one, and a real idea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>distinct from that of a tree, though far from being a particular image.
Again, it is said, that in conceiving of the idea of man in general, we
must conceive a man a particular sign or figure. I would ask first is
this to be understood merely of his height, or of his form in general?
If the latter, it would imply that we have, wherever we pronounce
the word <em>man</em>, no ideas at all, or a distinct conception of a man with
a head and limbs of a certain extent and proportion, of every turn in
each feature, of every variety in the formation of each part, as well as
of its distance from every other part, a knowledge which no sculptor
or painter ever had of any one figure of which he was the most
perfect master, for it would be a knowledge of an infinite number of
lines drawn in all directions from every part of the body, with their
precise length and terminations. Those who have consigned this
business of abstraction over to the senses with a view to make the
whole matter plain and easy, have not been aware of what they have
been doing. They supposed with the vulgar that it was only necessary
to open the eyes in order to see, and that the images produced by
outward objects are completely defined, and unalterable things, in
which there can be no dimness and confusion. These speculators
had no thought but they saw as much of a landscape as Poussin, and
knew as much about a face that was before them as Titian or Vandyke
would have done. This is a great mistake; the having particular
and absolute ideas of things is not only difficult, but impossible. The
ablest painters have never been able to give more than one part of
nature, in abstracted views of things. The most laborious artists
never finished to perfection any one part of an object, or had ever any
more than a confused, vague, uncertain notion of the shape of the
mouth or nose, or the colour of an eye. Ask a logician, or any
common man, and he will no doubt tell you that a face is a face, a
nose is a nose, a tree is a tree, and that he can see what it is as well
as another. Ask a painter and he will tell you otherwise. Secondly,
when it is asserted that we must necessarily have the idea of a
particular sign, when we think of any in general, all that is intended
by it is, I believe, that we must think of a particular height. This
idea it is supposed must be particular and determinate, just as we
must draw a line with a piece of chalk, or make a mark with the
slides of a measuring rule, in one place and not in the other. I think
it may be shewn that this view of the question is also utterly fallacious,
and out of the order of our ideas. The height of the individual is
thus resolved with the ideas of the lines terminating or defining it,
and the intermediate space of which it properly consists is entirely
forgotten. For let us take any given height of a man, whether tall,
short, or middle-sized, and let that height be as visible as you please,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>I would ask whether the actual height to which it amounts, does not
consist of a number of other lengths: as if it be a tall man, the
length will be six feet, and each of these feet will consist of so many
inches, and those inches will be again made up of decimals, and those
decimals of other subordinate parts, which must be all distinctly
placed, and added together before the sum total, which they compose,
can be pretended to be a distinct particular, or individual idea; I can
only understand by a particular thing either one precise individual, or
a precise number of individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of its being true that all general ideas of extension are
deducible to particular positive extension, the reverse proposition is
I think demonstrable: that all particular extensions, the most positive
and distinct, are never any thing else than a more or less vague notion
of extension in general. In any given visible object we have always
the general idea of something extended, and never of the precise
length; for the precise length as it is thought to be is necessarily
composed of a number of lengths too many, and too minute to be
necessarily attended to, or jointly conceived by the mind, and at last
loses itself in the infinite divisibility of matter. What sort of distinctness
or individual can therefore be found in any visible image, or
object of sense, I cannot well conceive: it seems to me like seeking
for certainty in the dancing of insects in the evening sun, or for
fixedness or rest in the motions of the sea. All particulars are
thought nothing but generals, more or less defined by circumstances,
but never perfectly so; in this all our knowledge both begins and
ends, and if we think to exclude all generality from our ideas of
things, we must be content to remain in utter ignorance. The proof
that our ideas of particular things are not themselves particular, is the
uncertainty and difficulty we have only in comparing them with one
another. In looking at a line an inch long, I have a certain general
impression of it, so that I can tell it is shorter than another, three or
four times as long, drawn on the same sheet of paper, but I cannot
immediately tell that it is shorter than one only a tenth or twentieth
of an inch longer. The idea which I have of it is therefore not an
exact one. In looking at a window I cannot precisely tell the
number of panes of glass it contains, yet I can easily say whether they
are few or many, whether the window is large or small. Now if all
our ideas were made up of particulars, we never could pronounce
generally whether there were few or many of these panes of glass,
but we should know the precise number, or at least pitch on some
precise number in our minds, and this we could not help knowing.
There must be either 5, 10, 20, or 30; for it is in vain to urge that
the idea in my mind is a floating one, and shifts from one of them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>another, so that I cannot tell the moment after which it was; but
what is this imperfect recollection but a confused contradictory and
abstract idea? Here is a plain dilemma: it is a fact that we have
some idea of a number of objects presented to us. It is also a fact
that we do not know the precise number, nor can we assign any
number confidently whether right or wrong. Whether this idea is
but an abstract and general one it seems hard to say. Those who
contend that we cannot have an idea of a man in general, without
conceiving of some particular man, seem to have little reason, since
the most particular idea we can form of a man, either in imagination
or from the actual impression, is but a general idea. Those who say
we cannot conceive of an army of men without conceiving of the
individuals composing it, ought to go a step further, and affirm that
we must represent to ourselves the features, form, complexion, size,
posture, and dress, with every other circumstance belonging to each
individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must admit the notion of abstraction, first or last, unless any
one will contend for this infinite refinement in our ideas of things, or
assert that we have no idea at all. For the same process takes place
in it, and is absolutely necessary to our most particular notions of
things, as well as our most general, namely, that of abstracting from
particulars, or of passing over the minute differences of things, taking
them in the gross, and attending to the general effect of a number of
distinguished and distinguishable impressions. It is thus we arrive at
our first notion of things, and thus that all our after knowledge is
acquired. The knowledge upon which our ideas rest is general, and
the only difference between abstract and particular, is that of being
more or less general, of leaving out more or fewer circumstances, and
more or fewer objects, perceived either at once or in succession, and
forming either a particular whole, aggregate, or a class of things.
It may be asked farther whether our ideas of things, however
abstract in general, with respect to the objects they represent, are not
in their own nature, and absolute existence particular. To this hard
question I shall return the best answer I can.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is sufficient to the present purpose that ideas are general in
their representation, however particular in themselves. Each idea is
something in itself, and not another idea. This is equally true of the
most abstract or particular ideas of things. The abstract idea of a
man is the abstract idea of a man, not the abstract idea of a horse,
nor the particular one of any given individual man. It is characterized
by general properties, and distinguished by general circumstances, and
is neither a mere word without any idea, nor a particular image of
one thing; so the idea of a particular man, though still only a general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>result from a number of particulars is sufficiently positive for the
actual purposes of thought, and distinguishable from that other general
result or impression which institutes the idea of a particular horse, for
instance.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That our general notions are any otherwise particular than as
they are the same with themselves, and different from one another, is
more than I know. I must demur on this question, whatever others
may do. Whatever contradictions are involved in the one side of it,
those on the other seem as great. For it is not easy to imagine any
thing more absurd than the supposition that the idea of a line for
instance is precisely, and to a hair’s breadth or to the utmost possible
exactness, of a certain length, when neither the precise number nor
the precise proportion of the parts composing this line are at all
known. It is like saying that we cast up an account to the utmost
degree of nicety, when not one of the items is known, but as of an
average conjecture or in round numbers. We generally estimate our
notion of a particular extension by the point or matter at all terminating
it, and it seems as if this did not admit of an ambiguity, or variation.
But in fact all ideas are a calculation of particulars, and when the
parts are only known in gross, the sum total, or resulting idea can
only be so too. The smallest division of which our notions are
susceptible is a general idea. In the progress of the understanding,
we never begin from absolute unity but always from something that
is more. How then is it possible that these general conceptions
should form a whole always commensurate to a precise number of
absolute unity I cannot conceive, any more than how it is possible to
express a fraction in whole numbers. The two things are incompatible.
As to any thing like conscious individuality, i.e. that which
assigneth limits to our ideas, we know they have it not.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. I would observe that ideas, as far as they are distinct and particular,
seem to involve a greater contradiction than when they are
confused and general. For, in proportion to their distinctness, must
be the number of different acts of the mind excited at the same time;
i.e. in proportion to the individuality of the image or idea, if I may
so express myself, the thought ceases to be individual, inasmuch as
the simplicity of the attention is thus necessarily broken and divided
into a number of different actions, which yet are all united in the
same conscious feeling, or there could be no connection between them.
How then we should ever be able to conceive of things distinctly,
clearly, and particularly, seems the wonder: not how different impressions
acting at once on the mind should be confused, and as it were
massed together, in a general feeling, for want of sufficient activity in
the intellectual faculties to give form and a distinct place to all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>throng of objects which at all times solicit the attention. Let any
one make the experiment of counting a flock of sheep driven fast
by him, and he will soon find his imagination unable to keep pace
with the rapid succession of objects, and his idea of particular number
slide into the general idea of multitude; not that because there are
more objects than he possibly can count, he will think there are many,
or that the word flock will present to his mind a mere name, without
any particulars corresponding to it. Every act of the attention, every
object we see or think of, presents a proof of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. I conceive that the mind has not been fairly dealt with in this
and other similar questions of the same sort. Matter alone seems to
have the privilege of presenting difficulties, and contradictions at every
turn; but the moment any thing of this kind is observed in the understanding,
all the petulance of logicians is up in arms, and the mind is
made the mark on which they vent all the modes and figures of their
impertinence. Let us take an example from some of these self-evident
matters of fact, which contain at least as many, and as great
contradictions, as any in the most abstruse metaphysical doctrine, such
as in extension, motion, and the curve of lines. Now as to the first
of these, extension: if we suppose it to be made up of points, which
are in themselves without extension, but by their combination produce
it, we must suppose two unextended things, when joined together, to
become extended, which is like supposing, that by adding together
several nothings, we can arrive at something. On the other hand, if
we suppose the ultimate parts of which extension is composed, to be
themselves extended, we then attribute extension to that which is
indivisible, or affirm a thing to consist of parts, and to have none, at
the same time. The old argument against the possibility of motion is
well known: it was said that the body moving must either be in the
place where it was, or in that into which it was passing. Now, if it
was in either of these, or in any one place, it must be at rest; and as
it could not be in both at once, it followed that a body moving could
exist no where, or that there was no such thing as motion in nature.
Again, a curve line is described mathematically by a point moving,
but always out of a strait line. Now, a strait line is the nearest
between any two points. But that a body should move forward, and
not move strait forward to the next point to which it is going, seems to
imply no less an absurdity than the affirming that a thing never moves
in the direction in which it is going, but always out of it; for, if it
moves in the same direction, the smallest moment of time, this is not
a curve, but a strait line; and if it does not continue to move in the
same direction at all, it seems utterly inconceivable that it should
make any progress, or move either in a curve or a strait line. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>any one who, on the strength of the contradiction involved in the
ideas of extension, motion, or curve lines, should severally deny or
disbelieve any one of them, would be thought to want common sense.
I think there are certain facts of the mind which are equally evident
and unaccountable. Those who contend that the one are to be
admitted, and the other not, because the one are the objects of sense,
and the other not, do not deserve any serious answer. It is as much
a fact, that I remember having seen the sun yesterday, as that I see
it to-day, and both of them are much more certain facts than that
there is any such body as the sun really existing out of the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will now return to Berkeley, and endeavour to answer his chief
objections to the doctrine of abstract ideas. First, then, I conceive
that he has himself virtually given up the question, when he allows
that the mind may be affected with the promise of a good thing, or
terrified by the apprehension of danger, without thinking of any particular
good or evil that is likely to befal us. What this idea of good
or evil, which is not particular, can be, other than abstract, I cannot
conceive; and to say that it is not an idea, but a mere feeling excited
by custom, is an answer very little to the purpose. For this feeling,
this custom, is itself a general impression, and could not, without a
power of abstraction in the mind, think, without a power of being
acted upon by a number of different impulses of pleasure and pain,
concurring to produce a general effect, abstracted from the particular
feelings themselves, or the objects first exciting them. All abstract
ideas are several impressions of the same kind, and are merely
customary affections of the mind, not distinct images of things. But if
it be said that the word idea properly signifies an image, and must be
something distinct, then I answer, first, that this would only restrict the
use of the word <em>idea</em> to particular things, and not affect the real question
in dispute, and secondly, that there is no such thing as a distinct
and particular image in the mind. The manner in which Berkeley
explains the nature of mathematical demonstrations, according to his
system, shews its utter inadequateness to any purposes of general reasoning,
and is a plain confession of the necessity of abstract ideas. For
all the answer he gives to the question, how can we know any proposition
to be true in general, from having found it so in a particular
instance, comes to this, that though the diagram we have in view
includes a number of particulars, yet we know the principle to be true
generally, because <em>there is not the least mention made of these particulars
in the proof of the proposition</em>. But I would ask also, whether there
is not the least thought of them in the mind? The truth is, that the
mind upon Berkeley’s principle must think of the particular right
angled, isosceles, triangle in question, or it can have no idea at all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>for it has no general idea of a triangle to which it can apply the name
generally. If we suppose that there is any such general form, or
notion to which the other particular circumstances are merely superadded,
and which may be left standing, though they are taken away,
we then run immediately to all the absurdities of abstraction, which
he so much wishes to avoid. If we then demonstrate the proposition
of the particular diagram before us, as of a determinate size, shape,
&#38;c., this demonstration cannot hold good generally. If we are
supposed to omit all these particular circumstances in our minds, then
we either demonstrate the proposition of the general and abstract idea
of a triangle, or of no idea at all; for after the particulars are omitted,
or not attended to by the mind, the only idea remaining must be a
general one. Farther, that on which I am willing to rest the whole
controversy, is the following remark, <em>viz.</em>, that without the general
idea of a line or triangle, there could be no particular one; that is, no
idea of any one line or triangle, as of the same form, or as any way
related to any other, so that there could be no common measure or
line to connect any of our thoughts or reasoning together into a general
conclusion. For to take the former instance as the most simple.
When we speak of any particular extension, it is evident that we
understand something which is not particular. Besides what is
peculiar to it, it must have something which is not peculiar to it,
but general, to merit the common appellation. Berkeley says, ‘An
idea which in itself is particular, becomes general, by being made to
represent or stand for all other particular ideas <em>of the same sort</em>.’ I do
request that the import of these last words may be attended to. Do
they suggest any idea or none; if they mean any thing, it must be
something more than the particular ideas which are said to be of the
same sort, <em>i.e.</em> some general notion of them. But this will involve all
the absurdities of abstraction. If there is any thing in the mind
besides these particular ideas themselves—any thing that compares or
contrasts them, that refers to this or that belief, this comparison or
classifying can be nothing but a perception of a general nature in
which these things agree, or the general resemblance which the mind
perceives between the several impressions. If there is no such comparison
or perception of resemblance, or idea of abstract qualities, then
there can be no idea answering to the words ‘of the same sort;’ but
these particular ideas will be left standing by themselves, absolutely
unconnected. As far as our ideas are merely particular, <em>i.e.</em> are
negations of other ideas, so far they must be perfectly distinct from
each other: there can be nothing between them to blend or associate
them together. Each separate idea would be surrounded with a
<i><span lang="fr">chevaux de frise</span></i> of its own, in a state of irreconcilable antipathy to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>every other idea, and the fair form of nature would present nothing
but a number of discordant atoms. A particular line would no more
represent another line, than it would represent a point: one colour
could no more resemble another colour, or suggest its idea, than it
could that of a sound, or a smell; there could be no clue to make us
class different shades of the same colour under one general name, any
more than the most opposite: one triangle would be as distinct from
another, as from a square or a cube, and so through the whole system
of art and nature. There must be a mutual leaning, a greater
proximity between some ideas than others: a common point to which
they tend, that is a common quality: a general nature, in which they
are identified: or there could not be in the mind more ideas of
same or like, or different, or judgment, or reasoning, or truth, or
falsehood, than in the stones in the fields, or the sands of the sea-shore.
The idea of classing things implies only the same sort of
general comparison, or abstract idea of likeness, that is necessary
to the idea of any simple sensible quality of an object. In both
cases, we only contemplate a number of things as alike or under
the same general notion, without attending to their actual differences.
Take the idea, for instance, of a slab of white marble.
As long as only one such piece of marble is considered, it is
supposed to be a particular object, and its whiteness is supposed to
be perceived by the mind as a simple sensible quality. If, on the
contrary, several such slabs of marble are presented to the mind, this
is commonly considered as producing a general idea of marble and of
whiteness. But this idea of whiteness, not as a quality of a particular
thing, but as a common quality of different things, is rejected by the
moderns as implying the supposition, that several different ideas can
coalesce in the same general notion, which amounts, they say, to the
contradiction that a thing may be the same, and different at the same
time. Now I would affirm whatever there is absurd or inconceivable
in this latter case applies equally to the former. For what possible
idea can any man form of a slab of white marble, in any other way
than that of abstraction? Is the idea of its whiteness as a sensible
quality the idea of a point. Is it one single impression? This
Berkeley and others deny, for they say there can be no idea of colour
without extension, or of quality without quantity. If there are in
this object several impressions of colour, I would ask are they all distinctly
perceived? Are they all the same? Or if not, are all their
differences perceived by the mind, before it possibly can be impressed
with the general idea of a certain sensible quality, or that the object
before it is white? Is the mind aware of even the slightest stain in
this object, of every thing that may happen to vary it? Yet, if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>idea falls anything short of this minute and perfect knowledge, it can
only be an imperfect and general notion. That is, a number of
differences must be massed together in a common feeling of likeness,
and a number of separate parts make up the idea of a given object.
Yet this is all that is implied in forming the ideas of whiteness in
general, as belonging to several objects, or of colour, or extension, or
any other idea whatever, drawn from numberless objects, impressed at
numberless times. If particular objects or qualities were single
things, there would then be some precise limit between them and
abstract or general ideas, but as the most particular object, or
qualities, as well as the most general combinations and classes of
things are necessarily confused and mixed results, and nothing more
than a number of impressions, never distinctly analyzed by the mind,
there can be no general reasoning to disprove abstracted ideas in the
common sense of the word.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON THE WRITINGS OF HOBBES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the following Essays I shall attempt to give some account of the
rise and progress of modern metaphysics, to state the opinions of the
principal writers who have treated on the subject, from the time of
Lord Bacon to the present day, and to examine the arguments by
which they are supported. In the first place, it will be my object to
shew what the real conclusions of the most celebrated authors were,
and the steps by which they arrived at them: to trace the connexion
or point out the difference between their several systems, as well as
to inquire into the peculiar bias and turn of their minds, and in what
their true strength or weakness lay. This will undoubtedly be best
done by an immediate reference to their works whenever the nature
of the subject admits of it, or whenever their mode of reasoning is not
so loose and desultory as to render the quotation of particular passages
a useless as well as endless labour. In the History of English
Philosophy, of which I published a prospectus some time ago, I
intended to have gone regularly through with all the writers of any
considerable note who fell within the limits of my plan, and to have
given a detailed analysis of their several subjects and arguments.
But this would lead to much greater length and minuteness of
inquiry than seems consistent with my present object, and would
besides, I am afraid, prove (what Hobbes, speaking of these subjects
in general, calls) ‘but dry discourse.’ To avoid this as much as
possible, I shall pass over all those writers who have not been distinguished
either by the boldness of their opinions, or the logical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>precision of their arguments. Indeed I shall confine my attention
more particularly to those who have made themselves conspicuous by
deviating from the beaten track, and who have struck out some
original discovery or brilliant paradox; whose metaphysical systems
trench the closest on morality, or whose speculations, by the interest
as well as novelty attached to them, have become topics of general
conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, besides stating the opinions of others, one principal
object which I shall have in view will be to act as judge or umpire
between them, to distinguish, as far as I am able, the boundaries of
true and false philosophy, and to try if I cannot lay the foundation
of a system more conformable to reason and experience, and, in its
practical results at least, approaching nearer to the common sense of mankind,
than the one which has been generally received by the most
knowing persons who have attended to such subjects within the last
century; I mean the material or <em>modern</em> philosophy, as it has been
called. According to this philosophy, as I understand it, all thought
is to be resolved into sensation, all morality into the love of pleasure,
and all action into mechanical impulse. These three propositions,
taken together, embrace almost every question relating to the human
mind, and in their different ramifications and intersections form a net,
not unlike that used by the enchanters of old, which, whosoever has
once thrown over him, will find all his efforts to escape vain, and his
attempts to reason freely on any subject in which his own nature is
concerned, baffled and confounded in every direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>This system, which first rose at the suggestion of Lord Bacon, on
the ruins of the school-philosophy, has been gradually growing up to
its present height ever since, from a wrong interpretation of the word
<em>experience</em>, confining it to a knowledge of things without us; whereas
it in fact includes all knowledge relating to objects either within or
out of the mind, of which we have any direct and positive evidence.
We only know that we ourselves exist, the most certain of all truths,
from the experience of what passes within ourselves. Strictly speaking,
all other facts of which we are not immediately conscious, are so
in a secondary and subordinate sense only. Physical experience is
indeed the foundation and the test of that part of philosophy which
relates to physical objects: further, physical analogy is the only rule
by which we can extend and apply our immediate knowledge, or
infer the effects to be produced by the different objects around us.
But to say that physical experiment is either the test or source or guide
of that other part of philosophy which relates to our internal perceptions,
that we are to look to external nature for the form, the substance,
the colour, the very life and being of whatever exists in our minds, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>that we can only infer the laws which regulate the phenomena of the
mind from those which regulate the phenomena of matter, is to confound
two things entirely distinct. Our knowledge of mental phenomena
from consciousness, reflection, or observation of their correspondent signs
in others is the true basis of metaphysical inquiry, as the knowledge of
<em>facts</em>, commonly so called, is the only solid basis of natural philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>To say that the operations of the mind and the operations of
matter are in reality the same, so that we may always make the one
exponents of the other, is to assume the very point in dispute, not
only without any evidence, but in defiance of every appearance to the
contrary. Lord Bacon was undoubtedly a great man, indeed one of
the greatest that have adorned this or any other country. He was a
man of a clear and active spirit, of a most fertile genius, of vast
designs, of general knowledge, and of profound wisdom. He united
the powers of imagination and understanding in a greater degree than
almost any other writer. He was one of the strongest instances of
those men, who by the rare privilege of their nature are at once poets
and philosophers, and see equally into both worlds. The schoolmen
and their followers attended to nothing but essences and species, to
laboured analyses and artificial deductions. They seem to have alike
disregarded both kinds of experience, that relating to external
objects, and that relating to the observation of our own internal
feelings. From the imperfect state of knowledge, they had not a
sufficient number of facts to guide them in their experimental
researches; and intoxicated with the novelty of their vain distinctions,
taught by rote, they would be tempted to despise the clearest and
most obvious suggestions of their own minds. Subtile, restless, and
self-sufficient, they thought that truth was only made to be disputed
about, and existed no where but in their demonstrations and
syllogisms. Hence arose their ‘logomachy’—their everlasting word-fights,
their sharp debates, their captious, bootless controversies.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Lord Bacon expresses it, ‘they were made fierce with dark
keeping,’ signifying that their angry and unintelligible contests with
one another were owing to their not having any distinct objects to
engage their attention. They built altogether on their own whims
and fancies, and buoyed up by their specific levity, they mounted in
their airy disputations in endless flights and circles, clamouring like
birds of prey, till they equally lost sight of truth and nature. This
great man therefore intended an essential service to philosophy, in
wishing to recall the attention to facts and ‘experience’ which had
been almost entirely neglected; and thus, by incorporating the abstract
with the concrete, and general reasoning with individual observation,
to give to our conclusions that solidity and firmness which they must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>otherwise always want. He did nothing but insist on the necessity of
‘experience,’ more particularly in natural science; and from the
wider field that is open to it there, as well as the prodigious success it
has met with, this latter application of the word, in which it is
tantamount to physical experiment, has so far engrossed the whole of
our attention, that mind has for a good while past been in some
danger of being overlaid by matter. We run from one error into
another; and as we were wrong at first, so in altering our course, we
have turned about to the opposite extreme. We despised ‘experience’
altogether before; now we would have nothing but ‘experience,’
and that of the grossest kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have, it is true, gained much by not consulting the suggestions
of our own minds in questions where they inform us of nothing;
namely, in the particular laws and phenomena of the natural world;
and we have hastily concluded, reversing the rule, that the best way
to arrive at the knowledge of ourselves also, was to lay aside the
dictates of our own consciousness, thoughts, and feelings, as deceitful
and insufficient guides, though they are the only means by which we
can obtain the least light upon the subject. We seem to have
resigned the natural use of our understandings, and to have given up
our own existence as a nonentity. We look for our thoughts and the
distinguishing properties of our minds in some image of them in
matter, as we look to see our faces in a glass. We no longer decide
physical problems by logical dilemmas, but we decide questions of
logic by the evidences of the senses. Instead of putting our reason
and invention to the rack indifferently on all questions, whether we
have any previous knowledge of them or not, we have adopted the
easier method of suspending the use of our faculties altogether, and
settling tedious controversies by means of ‘four champions fierce—hot,
cold, moist and dry,’ who with a few more of the retainers and
hangers-on of matter determine all questions relating to the nature of
man and the limits of the human understanding very learnedly. That
which we seek however, namely, the nature of the mind and the laws
by which we think, feel, and act, we must discover in the mind itself
or not at all. The mind has laws, powers, and principles of its own,
and is not the mere puppet of matter. This general bias in favour of
mechanical reasoning and physical experiment, which was the consequence
of the previous total neglect of them in matters where they
were strictly necessary, was strengthened by the powerful aid of
Hobbes, who was indeed the father of the modern philosophy. His
strong mind and body appear to have resisted all impressions but
those which were derived from the downright blows of matter: all
his ideas seemed to lie like substances in his brain: what was not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>solid, tangible, distinct, palpable object was to him nothing. The
external image pressed so close upon his mind that it destroyed the
power of consciousness, and left no room for attention to any thing
but itself. He was by nature a materialist. Locke assisted greatly
in giving popularity to the same scheme, as well by espousing many
of Hobbes’s metaphysical principles as by the doubtful resistance which
he made to the rest. And it has been perfected and has received its
last polish and roundness in the hands of some French philosophers,
as Condillac and others. It has been generally supposed that
Mr. Locke was the first person who, in his ‘Essay on the Human
Understanding’ established the modern metaphysical system on a
solid and immoveable basis. This is a great mistake. The system,
such as it is, existed entire in all its general principles in Hobbes
before him; this was never unequivocally or explicitly avowed by the
author of the ‘Essay on the Human Understanding.’ Locke merely
endeavoured to accommodate Hobbes’s leading principle to the more
popular opinions of the time; and all that succeeding writers have
done to improve upon his system, and clear it of inconsistent and
extraneous matter, has only tended to reduce it back to the purity
and simplicity in which it is to be found in Hobbes. The immediate
and professed object of both these writers is indeed the same, namely,
to account for our ideas and the formation of the human understanding
from sensible impressions. But in the execution of this design, Mr.
Locke has deviated widely and at almost every step from his predecessor.
This difference would almost unavoidably arise from the
natural character of their minds, which were the most opposite
conceivable. Hobbes had the utmost reliance on himself, and was
impatient of the least doubt or contradiction. He saw from the
beginning to the end of his system. He is always therefore on firm
ground, and never once swerves from his object. He is at no pains
to remove objections, or soften consequences. Granting his first
principle, all the rest follows of course. There is an air of grandeur
in the stern confidence with which he stands alone in the world of
his own opinions, regardless of his contemporaries, and conscious that
he is the founder of a new race of thinkers. Locke, on the other
hand, was a man, who without the same comprehensive grasp of
thought had a greater deference for the opinions of others, and was of
a much more cautious and circumspect turn of mind. He could not
but meet with many things in the peremptory assertions of Hobbes
that must make him pause, that he would be at a loss to reconcile to
an attentive observation of what passed in his own mind, and that
would equally shock the prevailing notions both of the learned and
the ignorant. He was therefore led to consider the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>objections to the system which had been left unanswered and
unnoticed, to make a compromise between the received doctrines, and
the violent paradoxes contained in the ‘Leviathan’ and the ‘Treatise
of Human Nature,’ or to admit these last with so many qualifications,
with so much circumlocution and preparation, and after such an
appearance of the most mature and candid examination, and of
willingness to be convinced on the other side of the question, as to
obviate the offensive and harsh effect which accompanies the abrupt
dogmatism of the original author. It was perhaps necessary that
the opinions of Hobbes should undergo this sort of metamorphosis
before they could gain a hearing: as the direct rays of the sun must
be blunted and refracted by passing through some denser medium in
order to be borne by common eyes. So sheathed and softened, their
sharp, unpleasant points taken off, his doctrines almost immediately
met with a favourable reception, and became popular. The general
principle being once established without its particular consequences,
and the public mind assured, it was soon found an easy task to point
out the inconsistency of Mr. Locke’s reasoning in many respects, and
to give a more decided tone to his philosophical system. Berkeley
was one of the first who tried the experiment of pushing his principles
into the verge of paradox on the question of abstract ideas, which he
has done with admirable dexterity and clearness, but without going
beyond the explicitness of Hobbes on the same question. Subsequent
writers added different chapters to supply the deficiencies of the Essay,
which, with scarcely a single exception, may be found essentially
comprized in that institute and digest of modern philosophy, our
author’s ‘Leviathan.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In thus giving the praise of originality and force of mind to Hobbes,
and regarding Locke merely as his follower, I may be thought to
venture on dangerous ground, or to lay unhallowed hands on a reputation
which is dear to every lover of truth. But if something is due
to fame, something is also due to justice. I confess however, that
having brought this charge against the ‘Essay on the Human Understanding,’
I am bound to make it good in the fullest manner;
otherwise, I shall be inexcusable.</p>

<p class='c007'>What I therefore propose in the remainder of the present Essay is
to show that Mr. Locke was not really the founder of the modern
system of philosophy as it respects the human mind; and I shall
think that I have sufficiently established this point, if I can make it
appear, both that the principle itself on which that system rests, and
all the striking consequences which have been deduced from it, are to
be found in the writings of Hobbes, more clearly, decidedly, and
forcibly expressed than they are in the ‘Essay on the Human Understanding.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>When I speak of the principle of the modern metaphysical
system, I mean the assumption that the operations of the intellect are
only a continuation of the impulses existing in matter, or that all the
thoughts and conceptions of the mind are nothing more nor less than
various modifications of the original impressions of things on a being
endued with sensation or simple perception. This system considers
ideas merely as they are caused by external objects, acting on the
organs of sense, and tries to account for them on that hypothesis
solely. It is upon this principle of excluding the understanding as a
distinct faculty or power from all share in its own operations, that the
whole of Hobbes’s reasoning proceeds. Let us see what he makes
of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first part of the ‘Leviathan,’ entitled ‘Of Man,’ begins in
this manner:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Chapter I.—Of Sense.</span>—‘Concerning the thoughts of man, I
will consider them, first singly, and afterwards in train, or dependence
upon one another. Singly, they are every one a representation or
appearance of some quality or other accident of a body without us;
which is commonly called an <em>object</em>: Which object worketh on the
eyes, ears, and other parts of man’s body; and by diversity of
working, produceth diversity of appearances.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The Original of them all is that which we call <span class='sc'>Sense</span>: For there
is no conception in a man’s mind which hath not at first, totally or by
parts, been begotten upon the organs of sense. The rest are derived
from that original.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The cause of sense is the external body or object which presseth
the organ proper to each sense, either immediately as in the taste and
touch, or mediately as in seeing, hearing, and smelling: which
pressure by the mediation of nerves, and other strings and membranes
of the body, continued inwards to the Brain and Heart, causeth there
a resistance or counter-pressure, or endeavour of the heart to deliver
itself: which endeavour, because <em>outward</em>, seemeth to be some matter
without. And this seeming or fancy is that which men call sense:
and consisteth to the eye, in a light or colour figured; to the ear, in
a sound; to the nostril, in an odour; to the tongue and palate, in a
savour, and to the rest of the body in heat, cold, hardness, softness,
and such other qualities, as we discern by feeling. All which qualities
called <em>sensible</em> are in the object that causeth them but so many several
motions of the matter by which it presseth our organs diversely.
Neither in us that are pressed are they any thing else but divers
motions; for motion produceth nothing but motion. But their
appearance to us is fancy, the same waking as dreaming. And as
pressing, rubbing, or striking the eye maketh us fancy a light, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>pressing the ear produceth a din, so do the bodies also we see or hear
produce the same by their strong, though unobserved action. For if
those colours and sounds were in the bodies or objects that cause
them, they could not be severed from them, as by glasses and in
echoes by reflection we see they are: where we know the thing we
see is in one place, the appearance in another, and though at some
certain distance, the real and very object seems invested with the
fancy it begets in us; yet still the object is one thing, the image or
fancy is another. So that sense in all cases is nothing else but
original fancy; caused, as I have said, by the pressure, that is, by the
motion of external things upon our eyes, ears, and other organs
thereunto ordained.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But the Philosophy-schools, through all the universities of Christendom,
grounded upon certain texts of Aristotle, teach another
doctrine; and say, For the cause of vision, that the thing seen
sendeth forth on every side a <em>visible species</em>, (in English) <em>a visible
show</em>, <em>apparition</em>, <em>aspect</em>, or <em>being seen</em>; the receiving whereof into the
eye, is <em>seeing</em>. And for the cause of <em>hearing</em>, that the thing heard
sendeth forth an <em>audible species</em>, that is, an <em>audible aspect</em>, or <em>audible
being seen</em>; which entering at the ear, maketh <em>hearing</em>. Nay, for the
cause of <em>understanding</em> also, they say the thing understood sendeth
forth an <em>intelligible species</em>, that is an <em>intelligible being seen</em>; which
coming into the understanding, makes us understand. I say not this
as disapproving the use of universities: but because I am to speak
hereafter of their office in a commonwealth, I must let you see on all
occasions by the way, what things would be amended in them;
amongst which the frequency of insignificant speech is one.’—<cite>Leviathan</cite>,
p. 4.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far our author. It is evident that in this account he has
laid the foundation of Berkeley’s ideal system, though he does not
seem any where to have gone the whole length of that doctrine. He
has entered more at large into this point in the ‘Discourse of Human
Nature,’ published in 1640, ten years before the ‘Leviathan’; and
as the subject is curious, and treated in a very decisive way, I
will quote the concluding passage, which is a recapitulation of the
rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘As colour is not inherent in the object, but an effect thereof upon
us, caused by such motion in the object as hath been described; so
neither is sound in the thing we hear, but in ourselves. One manifest
sign thereof is, that as a man may see, so also he may hear double or
treble, by multiplication of echoes, which echoes are sounds as well
as the original, and not being in one and the same place, cannot be
inherent in the body that maketh them. And to proceed to the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of the senses, it is apparent enough that the smell and taste of the
same thing are not the same to every man, and therefore are not in
the thing smelt or tasted, but in the men. So likewise the heat we
feel from the fire is manifestly in us, and is quite different from the
heat which is in the fire: for our heat is pleasure or pain, according
as it is great or moderate; but in the coal there is no such thing.
By this the fourth and last proposition is proved; viz. That as in
vision, so also in conceptions that arise from other senses, the subject
of their inherence is not in the object, but in the sentient. And
from hence also it followeth that whatsoever accidents or qualities
our senses make us think there be in the world, they be not there,
but are seeming and apparitions only: the things that really are in
the world without us, are those motions by which these seemings are
caused. And this is the great deception of sense, which also is to
be by sense corrected: for as sense telleth me, when I see directly,
that the colour seemeth to be in the object; so also sense telleth me
when I see by reflection, that colour is not in the object.’—<cite>Human
Nature</cite>, chap. ii. p. 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second chapter of the ‘Leviathan’ contains an account of the
manner in which our ideas are generated, and is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will
lie still for ever, is a truth that no man doubts of. But that when a
thing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat
else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely, that nothing can
change itself) is not so easily assented to. For men measure not
only other men, but all other things by themselves; and because they
find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, think every
thing else grows weary of motion, and seeks repose of its own accord;
little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that
desire of rest they find in themselves consisteth. From hence it is,
that the Schools say, heavy bodies fall downward out of an appetite
to rest, and to conserve their nature in that place which is most
proper for them: ascribing appetite and knowledge of what is good
for their conservation (which is more than man has) to things
inanimate, absurdly.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘When a body is once in motion, it moveth (unless something else
hinder it) eternally: and whatsoever hindereth it, cannot in an
instant, but in time and by degrees quite extinguish it. And as we
see in the water, though the wind cease, the waves give not over
rolling for a long time after; so also it happeneth in that motion
which is made in the internal parts of a man then, when he sees,
hears, &#38;c. For after the object is removed or the eye shut, we still
retain an image of the thing seen, though more obscure than when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>we see it. And this is it the Latins call <em>imagination</em>, from the image
made in seeing; and apply the same, though improperly, to all the
other senses. But the Greeks call it <em>fancy</em>; which signifies appearance,
and is as proper to one sense, as to another. Imagination is
therefore nothing but <em>decaying sense</em>; and is found in man and many
other living creatures, as well sleeping as waking.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The decay of sense in men waking is an obscuring of it in such
manner as the light of the sun obscureth the light of the stars, which
stars do no less exercise their virtue by which they are visible in the
day than in the night. But because amongst many strokes, which
our eyes, ears, and other organs receive from external bodies, the
predominant only is sensible, therefore the light of the sun being
predominant, we are not affected with the action of the stars. And
any object being removed from our eyes, though the impression it
made in us remain; yet other objects more present succeeding, and
working on us, the imagination of the past is obscured, and made
weak; as the voice of a man is in the noise of the day. From
whence it follows, that the longer the time is, after the sight or sense
of any objects the weaker is the imagination. For the continual
change of man’s body destroys in time the parts which in sense were
moved: so that distance of time and of place hath one and the same
effect in us. For as at a great distance of place, that which we look
at appears dim, and without distinction of the smaller parts, and as
voices grow weak and inarticulate, so also after great distance of
time, our imagination of the past is weak; and we lose (for example)
of cities we have seen many particular streets, and of actions, many
particular circumstances. This decaying sense, when we would
express the thing itself (I mean fancy itself) we call Imagination, as
I said before: but when we would express the decay, and signify
that the sense is fading, old and past, it is called <em>Memory</em>. So that
imagination and memory are but one thing which for divers considerations
hath divers names. Much memory or memory of many things
is called Experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Again, imagination being only of those things which have been
formerly perceived by sense, either all at once, or by parts at several
times, the former (which is the imagining the whole object as it was
presented to the sense) is <em>simple imagination</em>; as when one imagineth a
man or horse which he hath seen before. The other is <em>compounded</em>,
as when from the sight of a man at one time, and of a horse at
another, we conceive in our mind a centaur. So when a man compoundeth
the image of his own person with the image of the actions
of another man; as when a man conceives himself a Hercules or an
Alexander (which happeneth often to them which are much taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>with the reading of Romaunts) it is a compound imagination, and
properly but a fiction of the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There be also other imaginations that rise in man, (though
waking) from the great impression made in sense: as from gazing
upon the sun, the impression leaves an image of the sun before our
eyes a long time after; and from being long and vehemently attent
upon geometrical figures, a man shall in the dark (though awake)
have the image of lines and angles before his eyes: which kind of
fancy hath no particular name; as being a thing that doth not
commonly fall into men’s discourse.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The imaginations of them that sleep are those we call dreams:
and these also (as all other imaginations) have been before, either
totally or by parcels in the sense, and because the brain and nerves,
which are the necessary organs of sense, are so benumbed in sleep, as
not easily to be moved by the action of external objects, there can
happen in sleep no imagination; and therefore no dream but what
proceeds from the agitation of the inward parts of man’s body;
which inward parts, for the connexion they have with the brain and
other organs, when they be distempered, do keep the same in motion;
whereby the imaginations there formerly made, appear as if a man
were waking; saving that the organs of sense being now benumbed,
so as there is no new object, which can master and obscure them
with a more vigorous impression, a dream must needs be more clear
in this silence of sense, than are our waking thoughts. And hence it
cometh to pass, that it is a hard matter, and by many thought
impossible, to distinguish exactly between sense and dreaming. For
my part, when I consider that in dreams I do not often, nor constantly
think of the same persons, places, subjects, and actions that
I do waking; nor remember so long a train of coherent thoughts
dreaming, as at other times; and because waking I often observe the
absurdity of dreams, but never dream of the absurdities of my waking
thoughts,—I am well satisfied, that being awake, I know I dream
not; though when I dream, I think myself awake.’—<cite>Leviathan</cite>,
pp. 4, 5, 6.</p>

<p class='c007'>The concluding paragraph of this Chapter is remarkable.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The imagination that is raised in man (or any other creature
endued with the faculty of imagining) by words or other voluntary
signs, is that we generally call <em>Understanding</em>: and is common to
man and beast. For a dog by custom will understand the call or
rating of his master, and so will many other beasts. That understanding
which is peculiar to man, is the understanding not only his
will, but his conceptions and thoughts, by the sequel and contexture
of the names of things into affirmations, negations, and other forms of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>speech; and of this kind of understanding I shall speak hereafter.’—Page
8.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the first two chapters Mr. Hobbes endeavours to show that
all our thoughts, considered singly or in themselves, have their origin
in sensation, so in the next chapter, he resolves all their combinations
or connexions one with another into the principle of association, or
the coexistence of their sensible impressions.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘By consequence or train of thoughts,’ he says, ‘I understand that
succession of one thought to another, which is called (to distinguish
it from discourse in words) <em>mental discourse</em>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘When a man thinketh on any thing whatsoever, his next thought
after it is not altogether so casual as it seems to be. Not every thought
to every thought succeeds indifferently. But as we have no imagination,
whereof we have not formerly had sense in whole or in parts;
so we have no transition from one imagination to another, whereof
we never had the like before in our senses. The reason whereof is
this. All fancies are motions within us, reliques of those made in
sense: and those motions that succeeded one another in the sense,
continue also together after sense: insomuch as the former coming
again to take place, and be predominant, the latter followeth, by
coherence of the matter moved, in such manner, as water upon a
plane table is drawn which way any one part of it is guided by the
finger. But because in sense to one and the same thing perceived,
sometimes one thing, sometimes another succeedeth, it comes to pass
in time, that in the imagining of any thing, there is no certainty what
we shall imagine next. Only this is certain, it shall be something
that succeeded the same before, at one time or another.’—Page 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>The comprehension and precision with which the law of association
is here unfolded as the key to every movement of the mind, and
as regulating every wandering thought, cannot be too much admired;
it is enough to say that Hartley, who certainly understood more of
the power of association than any other man, has added nothing to
this short passage, as far as relates to the succession of ideas. He
has indeed extended its application in unravelling the fine web of our
affections and feelings, by showing how one idea transfers the feeling
of pleasure or pain to others associated with it, which is not here
noticed. Whether this principle really has all the extent and efficacy
ascribed to it by either of these writers will be made the subject of a
future inquiry. How well our author understood the question, and
how much it had assumed a consistent and systematic form in his
mind will appear from the instances he brings in illustration of this
intricate and at the time almost unthought-of subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The train of thoughts or mental discourse is of two sorts. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>first is unguided, without design and inconstant; wherein there is no
passionate thought to govern and direct those that follow to itself as
the end and scope of some desire or other passion; in which case the
thoughts are said to wander and seem impertinent one to another as in
a dream. Such are commonly the thoughts of men, that are not
only without company, but also without care of any thing: though
even then their thoughts are as busy as at other times, but without
harmony, as the sound which a lute out of tune would yield to any
man, or in tune to one that could not play. And yet in this wild
ranging of the mind, a man may ofttimes perceive the way of it, and
the dependence of one thought upon another. For in a discourse of
our present civil war, what could seem more impertinent than to ask
(as one did) what was the value of a Roman penny? Yet the
coherence to me was manifest enough. For the thoughts of the war
introduced the thought of the delivering up the king to his enemies;
the thought of that brought in the thought of the delivering up of
Christ; and that again the thought of the thirty pence, which was
the price of that treason: and thence easily followed that malicious
question; and all this in a moment of time; for thought is quick.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The second’ [that is the second sort of association] ‘is more
constant, as being regulated by some desire, and design. For the
impression made by such things as we desire or fear, is strong and
permanent, or, if it cease for a time, of quick return; so strong it is
sometimes as to hinder and break our sleep. From desire ariseth the
thought of some means we have seen produce the like of what we
aim at: and from the thought of that, the thought of means to that
mean, and so continually till we come to some beginning within our
own power.’</p>

<p class='c007'>He adds,—‘This train of regulated thoughts is of two kinds: one,
when of an effect imagined, we seek the causes or means that produce
it; and this is common to man and beast. The other is when imagining
anything whatsoever, we seek all the possible effects that can
by it be produced: that is to say, we imagine what we can do with it
when we have it. Of which I have not at any time seen any sign
but in man only; for this is a curiosity hardly incident to the nature
of any living creature that has no other passion but sensual, such as
are hunger, thirst, lust, and anger. In sum, the discourse of the mind
when it is governed by design, is nothing but seeking or the faculty of
invention, which the Latins call <i><span lang="la">sagacitas</span></i> and <i><span lang="la">solertia</span></i>, a finding out of
the causes of some effect, present or past; or of the effects of some
present or past cause. Sometimes a man desires to know the event of
an action; and then he thinketh of some like action past, and the
events thereof one after another; supposing like events will follow like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>actions. As he that foresees what will become of a criminal, re-cons
what he has seen follow on the like crime before; having this order
of thoughts, the crime, the officer, the prison, the judge, and the
gallows, which kind of thoughts is called foresight, and prudence or
providence; and sometimes wisdom; though such conjecture, through
the difficulty of observing all circumstances, be very fallacious. But
this is certain; by how much one man has more experience of things
past than another; by so much also he is more prudent; and his
expectations the seldomer fail him. The present only has a being in
nature; things past have a being in the memory only, but things to
come have no being at all; the future being but a fiction of the mind,
applying the sequels of actions past to the actions that are present;
which with most certainty is done by him that has most experience;
but not with certainty enough, and though it be called prudence when
the event answereth our expectation, yet in its own nature it is but
presumption; for the foresight of things to come, which is providence,
belongs only to him by whose will they are to come: from him only,
and supernaturally, proceeds prophecy. The best prophet naturally
is the best guesser; and the best guesser, he that is most versed and
studied in the matters he guesses at; for he hath most signs to guess
by.’—Page 10.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this account he immediately adds,—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There is no other act of man’s mind that I can remember, naturally
planted in him, so as to need no other thing to the exercise of it
but to be born a man, and live with the use of his five senses. Those
other faculties, of which I shall speak by and by, and which seem
proper to man only, are acquired, and increased by study and industry;
and of most men learned by instruction and discipline; and proceed
all from the invention of words and speech: for besides sense and
thoughts, and the train of thoughts, the mind of man has no other
motion, though by the help of speech and method, the same faculties
may be improved to such a height, as to distinguish men from all
other living creatures.’—Page 11.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conclusion of this chapter in which the author treats of the
limits of the imagination is too important, and has laid the foundation
of too many speculations, to be passed over. ‘Whatsoever we imagine
is finite. Therefore there is no idea, or conception of any thing we
call infinite. No man can have in his mind an image of infinite magnitude;
nor conceive infinite swiftness, infinite time, or infinite force,
or infinite power. When we say any thing is infinite, we signify only
that we are not able to conceive the ends and bounds of the thing
named; having no conception of the thing, but of our own inability:
and therefore the name of God is used, not to make us conceive him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>(for he is incomprehensible and his greatness and power are inconceivable)
but that we may honour him. And because whatsoever we conceive
has been perceived first by sense, either all at once, or by parts, a
man can have no thought, representing any thing, not subject to sense.
No man, therefore, can conceive any thing, but he must conceive it in
some place, and indued with some determinate magnitude, and which
may be divided into parts; not that any thing is all in this place, and
all in another place at the same time; nor that two or more things
can be in one and the same place at once: for none of these things
ever have, nor can be incident to sense; but are absurd speeches,
taken upon credit (without any signification at all), from deceived
philosophers, and deceived, or deceiving schoolmen.’—Page 11.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the extracts which I shall next borrow from his account of
language and reasoning, it will appear that our author not only threw
out the first hints of the modern system, which reduces all reasoning
and understanding to the mechanism of language, but that by a very
high kind of abstraction, he carried it to perfection at once. The
whole race of plodding commentators, or dashing paradox-mongers
since his time have not advanced a step beyond him. I shall give this
part somewhat at large, both because the question is intricate in itself,
and as it will serve as a specimen of his general mode of writing, in
which dry sarcasm, keen observation, extensive thought, and the most
rigid logic conveyed in a concise and masterly style, are all brought to
bear upon the same object.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The invention of printing,’ he says, ‘though ingenious, compared
with the invention of letters is no great matter. But who was the
first that found the use of letters, is not known. He that first brought
them into Greece, men say, was Cadmus, the son of Agenor, King of
Phœnicia. A profitable invention for continuing the memory of
time past, and the conjunction of mankind, dispersed into so many and
distant regions of the earth; and withal difficult, as proceeding from a
watchful observation of the divers motions of the tongue, palate, lips,
and other organs of speech, whereby to make as many differences of
characters to remember them; but the most noble and profitable invention
of all other, was that of speech, consisting of names or appellations,
and their connections; whereby men register their thoughts, recall
them when they are past, and also declare them one to another for
mutual utility and conversation; without which there had been
amongst men, neither commonwealth, nor society, nor contract, nor
peace, no more than amongst lions, bears, and wolves. The first
author of speech was God himself, that instructed Adam how to name
such creatures as he presented to his sight; for the scripture goeth no
farther in this matter. But this was sufficient to direct him to add
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>more names, as the experience and use of the creatures should give
him occasion; and to join them in such manner by degrees, as to
make himself understood, and so by succession of time, so much
language might be gotten, as he had found use for; though not so
copious as an orator or philosopher has need of: for I do not find any
thing in the scripture, out of which, directly or by consequence can
be gathered, that Adam was taught the names of all figures, numbers,
measures, colours, sounds, fancies, relations; much less the names of
words and speech, as, general, special, affirmative, negative, interrogative,
optative, infinitive, all which are useful; and least of all, of entity,
intentionality, quiddity, and other insignificant words of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The manner how speech serveth to the remembrance of the consequence
of causes and effects, consisteth in the imposing of names,
and the connexion of them. Of names, some are proper, and singular
to one only thing; as <em>Peter</em>, <em>John</em>, <em>this man</em>, <em>this tree</em>: and some are
common to many things; <em>man</em>, <em>horse</em>, <em>tree</em>; every of which though
but one name, is nevertheless the name of divers particular things;
in respect of all which together, it is called an universal; there being
nothing in the world universal but names; for the things named are every
one of them individual and singular. One universal name is imposed
on many things for their similitude in some quality, or other accident:
and whereas a proper name bringeth to mind one thing only, universals
recall any one of those many. By this imposition of names, some of
larger, some of stricter signification, we turn the reckoning of the consequences
of things imagined in the mind, into a reckoning of the
consequences of appellations. For example: a man that hath no use
of speech at all, that is born and remains perfectly deaf and dumb, if he
set before his eyes a triangle, and by it two right angles (such as are the
corners of a square figure,) he may by meditation compare and find,
that the three angles of that triangle are equal to those two right angles
that stand by it: but if another triangle be shown him different in shape
from the former, he cannot know without a new labour, whether the
three angles of that also be equal to the same. But he that hath the
use of words, when he observes that such equality was consequent, not to
the length of the sides, nor to any other particular thing in his triangle
but only to this, that the sides were straight, and the angles three and
that that was all for which he named it a triangle, will boldly conclude
universally that such equality of angles is in all triangles whatsoever,
and register his invention in these general terms: every triangle
hath its three angles equal to two right angles. And thus the consequence
found in one particular, comes to be registered and remembered
as an universal rule; discharges our mental reckoning of time and place;
delivers us from all labour of the mind, saving the first, and makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>that which was found true here, and now, to be true in all times and
places. But the use of words in registering our thoughts, is in nothing
so evident as in numbering. A natural fool that could never learn by
heart the order of numeral words, as <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>, and <em>three</em>, may observe
every stroke of the clock, and nod to it, or say <em>one</em>, <em>one</em>; but can never
know what hour it strikes. And it seems, there was a time when
those names of number were not in use, and men were fain to apply
their fingers of one or both hands to those things they desired to keep
account of; and that thence it proceeds, that now our numeral words
are but ten, in any nation, and in some but five, and then they begin
again. And he that can tell ten, if he recite them out of order, will
lose himself, and not know when he hath done: much less will he be
able to add, and subtract, and perform all other operations of arithmetic.
So that without words there is no possibility of reckoning of numbers;
much less of magnitudes, of swiftness, of force, and other things, the
reckoning whereof is necessary to the being, or well-being of mankind.’—<cite>Leviathan</cite>,
chap. iv., pp. 12, 14.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same train of reasoning occurs in the ‘Discourse of Human
Nature,’ with some variation in the expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘By the advantage of names it is that we are capable of science,
which beasts for want of them are not; nor man, without the use of
them; for as a beast misseth not one or two out of her many young
ones, for want of those names of order, <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>, and <em>three</em>, and which
we call <em>number</em>; so neither would a man without repeating orally or
mentally those words of number, know how many pieces of money or
other things lie before him. Seeing there be many conceptions of one
and the same thing, and that for every conception we give it a several
name, it followeth that for one and the same thing, we have many
names or attributes; as to the same man we give the appellations
of <em>just</em>, <em>valiant</em>, <em>strong</em>, <em>comely</em>, &#38;c. And again, because from divers
things we receive like conceptions, many things must needs have the
same appellations: as to all things we <em>see</em> we give the name of <em>visible</em>.
Those names we give to many, are called universal to them all: as
the name of <em>man</em> to every particular of mankind. Such appellations
as we give to one only thing, we call individual, or singular; as
<em>Socrates</em> and other proper names, or by circumlocution, <em>He that writ
the Iliads</em>, for <em>Homer</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The universality of one name to many things hath been the cause
that men think the <em>things</em> are themselves universal: and so seriously
contend that besides Peter and John, and all the rest of the men that
are, have been, or shall be in the world, there is yet something else
that we call man, viz. <em>Man in general</em>, deceiving themselves by taking
the universal or general appellation for the thing it signifieth. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>if one should desire the painter to make him the picture of a man,
which is as much as to say of a man in general, he meaneth no more
but that the painter should choose what man he pleaseth to draw,
which must needs be some of them that are or have been or may be,
none of which are universal. But when he would have him to draw
the king or any particular person, he limiteth the painter to that one
person he chooseth. It is plain therefore there is nothing universal
but names, which are therefore called indefinite, because we limit them
not ourselves, but leave them to be applied by the hearer: whereas a
singular name is limited and restrained to one of the many things it
signifieth, as when we say, <em>This man</em>, pointing to him, or giving him
his proper name, or in some such way.’—<cite>Human Nature</cite>, chap. v.
pp. 25, 26.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall have occasion to see, in the course of this inquiry, how
exactly Berkeley’s account of the process of abstraction, in contradiction
to Locke’s opinion, corresponds in every particular with
this passage of our author. To return to his account of truth,
reason, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘When two names are joined together into a consequence or
affirmation, by the help of this little verb, <em>is</em>, as thus: <em>a man is a
living creature</em>; if the latter name, <em>living creature</em>, signify all that the
former name, <em>man</em>, signifieth, then the affirmation or consequence is
true; otherwise false. For True and False are attributes of speech,
not of things. And where speech is not, there is neither truth nor
falsehood. Error there may be, as when we expect that which shall
not be, or suspect what has not been: but in neither case can a man
be charged with untruth.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Seeing, then, that truth consisteth in the right ordering of names
in our affirmations, a man that seeketh precise truth had need to
remember what every name he uses stands for, and to place it accordingly:
or else he will find himself entangled in words, as a bird in
lime-twigs. And therefore in Geometry (which is the only science
that it has pleased God hitherto to bestow on mankind) men begin
at settling the significations of their words, which settling of significations
they call definitions, and place them in the beginning of their
reckoning. By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that
aspires to true knowledge to examine the definitions of former authors,
and either to correct them when they are negligently set down, or to
make them himself. For the errors of definition multiply themselves
according as the reckoning proceeds; and lead men into absurdities
which they at last see, but cannot avoid without reckoning anew from
the beginning. From whence it happens that they which trust to
books do as they that cast up many little sums into a greater, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>considering whether those little sums were rightly cast up or not, and
at last finding the error visible, and not mistrusting their first grounds,
know not which way to clear themselves, but spend time in fluttering
over their books, as birds that entering by the chimney, and finding
themselves enclosed in a chamber, flutter at the false light of a glass
window, for want of wit to consider which way they came in. So
that in the right definition of names, lies the first use of speech, which
is the acquisition of science, and in wrong or no definitions lies the
first abuse, from which proceed all false and senseless tenets; which
make them that take their instruction from the authority of books and
not from their own meditations, to be as much below the condition of
ignorant men, as men endued with true science are above it. For
between true science and erroneous doctrines, ignorance is in the
middle. Natural sense and imagination are not subject to absurdity.
Nature itself cannot err; and as men abound in copiousness of
language, so they become more wise or more mad than ordinary.
Nor is it possible without letters for any man to become either excellently
wise or (unless his memory be hurt by disease or ill constitution
of organs) excellently foolish. For words are wise men’s
counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the money of
fools, that value them by the authority of an Aristotle, a Cicero, a
Thomas Aquinas, or any other doctor whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Subject to names is whatsoever can enter into, or be considered in
an account, and be added one thing to another to make a sum, or
subtracted one from another and leave a remainder. The Latins
called accounts of money <i><span lang="la">rationes</span></i>, and accounting, <i><span lang="la">ratiocinatio</span></i>, and
that which we in bills or books of accounts call <em>items</em>, they call <i><span lang="la">nomina</span></i>,
or names; and thence it seems to proceed that they extended the
word <em>ratio</em> to the faculty of reckoning in all other things. The
Greeks have but one word, <span lang="grc">λογος</span> for both speech and reason, not
that they thought there was no speech without reason, but no reason
without speech: and the act of reasoning they call syllogism, which
signifieth summing up (or putting together) the consequences of one
saying to another. For reason is nothing but reckoning (that is,
adding and subtracting) of the consequences of general names agreed
upon for the marking and signifying of our thoughts; I say marking
them, when we reckon by ourselves, and signifying them, when we
demonstrate or approve our reckonings to other men.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘And as in arithmetic, unpractised men must, and professors themselves
may, often err, and cast up false, so also in any other subject
of reasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised men may
deceive themselves, and infer false conclusions: not but that reason
itself is always right reason, as well as arithmetic is a certain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>infallible art. But no one man’s reason, nor the reason of any
number of men makes the certainty: no more than an account is
therefore well cast up, because a great many men have unanimously
approved it. And, therefore, as when there is a controversy in an
account, the parties must by their own accord set up for right reason
the reason of some arbitrator or judge, so it is in all debates of what
kind soever: and when men that think themselves wiser than all
others, clamour and demand right reason for judge, yet seek no more
but that things should be determined by no other men’s reason but
their own, it is as intolerable in the society of men as it is in play,
after trump is turned, to use for trump on every occasion that suit
whereof they have most in their hand. For they do nothing else that
will have every of their passions, as it comes to bear sway in them,
to be taken for right reason, and that in their own controversies,
betraying their want of right reason by the claim they lay to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘When a man reckons without the use of words, which may be
done in particular things (as when upon the sight of any one thing,
we conjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to follow
upon it), if that which he thought likely to have preceded it, hath
not preceded it, this is called error, to which even the most prudent
men are subject. But when we reason in words of general signification,
and fall upon a general inference which is false, though it be
commonly called error, it is indeed an absurdity or senseless speech.
For error is but a deception in presuming that somewhat is past, or to
come, of which, though it were not past, or not to come, yet there
was no impossibility discoverable. But when we make a general
assertion, unless it be a true one, the possibility of it is inconceivable.
And words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we
call absurd, insignificant, and nonsense. And, therefore, if a man
should talk to me of <em>a round quadrangle</em>, or <em>accidents of bread in cheese</em>,
or <em>immaterial substances</em>, or <em>of a free subject</em>, a <em>free-will</em>, or any <em>free</em> but
free from being hindered by opposition; I should not say he were in
an error, but that his words were without meaning, that is to say,
absurd.’—Chap. iv. v., pp. 15, 18, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account of the passions and affections which follows next in
order, is the same in almost every particular as that which is given in
modern treatises on this subject, except that Mr. Hobbes seems to
make curiosity or the desire of knowledge, an original passion of the
mind, peculiar to man. From this part I shall only quote two passages,
and then proceed to his treatise on the ‘Doctrine of Necessity,’ which
will conclude my account of this author.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first passage is the one from which Locke has copied his
famous definition of the difference between wit and judgment. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>observing (Chap. viii.) that the difference of men’s talents does not
depend on natural capacity, which, he says, is nothing else but sense,
wherein men differ so little from one another, or from brutes, that it
is not worth the reckoning, he goes on:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘This difference of quickness in imagining is caused by the difference
of men’s passions, that love and dislike, some one thing, some another,
and therefore some men’s thoughts run one way, some another, and
are held to and observe differently the things that pass through their
imagination. And whereas in this succession of thoughts there is
nothing to observe in the things they think on, but either in what
they be like one another or in what they be unlike—those that
observe their similitudes, in case they be such as are but rarely
observed by others, are said to have a good wit, by which is meant
on this occasion a good fancy. But they that observe their differences
and dissimilitudes, which is called distinguishing and discerning and
judging between thing and thing, in case such discerning be not easy,
are said to have a good judgment; and particularly, in matter of
conversation and business, wherein times, places, and persons are to
be discerned, this virtue is called discretion. The former, that is,
fancy, without the help of judgment, is not commended for a virtue,
but the latter which is judgment or discretion, is commended for
itself, without the help of fancy.’ p. 32. This definition, which
Locke took entire from our author without acknowledgment, and
which has been so often referred to, is evidently false, for as Harris,
the author of ‘Hermes,’ has very well observed, the finding out the
equality of the three angles of a triangle to two right ones would
upon the principle here stated, be a piece of wit instead of an act of
the understanding or judgment, and ‘Euclid’s Elements’ a collection
of epigrams.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The other passage which I proposed to quote chiefly
as an instance of our author’s power of imagination, is as follows. In
speaking of the degree of madness, as in fanatics and others, he says:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>‘Though the effect of folly in them that are possessed of an opinion
of being inspired be not always visible in one man, by any very
extravagant action that proceedeth from such passion, yet when many
of them conspire together, the rage of the whole multitude is visible
enough. For what greater argument of madness can there be than
to clamour, strike, and throw stones at our best friends? Yet this is
somewhat less than such a multitude will do. For they will clamour,
fight against, and destroy those, by whom, all their lifetime before,
they have been protected and secured from injury. And if this be
madness in the multitude, it is the same in every particular man.
For as in the midst of the sea, though a man perceive no sound of
that part of the water next him, yet he is well assured that part contributes
as much to the roaring of the sea as any other part of the
same quantity, so also though we perceive no great unquietness in one
or two men, yet we may be well assured that their singular passions
are parts of the seditious roaring of a troubled nation.’ Even Mr.
Burke did not disdain to borrow one of Hobbes’s images. The
author of the ‘Leviathan’ compares those who attempt to reform a
decayed commonwealth to ‘the foolish daughters of Pelias who
desiring to renew the youth of their decrepit father did by the
counsel of Medea cut him in pieces and boil him, together with
strange herbs, but made not of him a new man.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I think this is better expressed than the same allusion in Burke,
which is I dare say well known to my readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall not here enter into the doctrine of Liberty and Necessity,
which Hobbes has stated with great force and precision as a general
question of cause and effect, and without any particular reference to
his mechanical theory of the mind, as I shall fully investigate this
subject in my next Essay.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have thus taken a review of the metaphysical writings of Hobbes,
as far as was necessary to establish what I at first proposed, namely,
the general conformity, and almost entire coincidence between his
opinions, and the principles of the modern system of philosophy.
The praise of originality at least, of boldness and vigour of mind,
belongs to him. The strength of reason which his application of a
general principle to explain almost all the phenomena of human nature
implies, can hardly be surpassed. The truth of the system is another
question, which I shall hereafter proceed to consider.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will first, however, distinctly enumerate the leading principles of
his philosophy, as they are to be found in Hobbes, and in the latest
writers of the same School. They are, I conceive, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That all our ideas are derived from external objects, by means
of the senses alone.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>2. That as nothing exists out of the mind but matter and motion,
so it is itself with all its operations nothing but matter and motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That thoughts are single, or that we can think of only one
object at a time. In other words, that there is no comprehensive
power or faculty of understanding in the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That we have no general or abstract ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. That the only principle of connexion between one thought and
another is association, or their previous connexion in sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. That reason and understanding depend entirely on the mechanism
of language.</p>

<p class='c007'>7 and 8. That the sense of pleasure and pain is the sole spring of
action, and self-interest the source of all our affections.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. That the mind acts from a mechanical or physical necessity,
over which it has no controul, and consequently is not a moral or
accountable agent.—The manner of stating and reasoning upon this
point is the only circumstance of importance in which modern writers
differ from Hobbes.</p>

<p class='c007'>10. That there is no difference in the natural capacities of men,
the mind being originally passive to all impressions alike, and becoming
whatever it is from circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of these positions it is my intention to oppose to the utmost of
my ability. Except the first, they are most or all of them either
denied or doubtfully admitted by Locke. And as it is his admission
of the first principle which has opened a door, directly or indirectly,
to all the rest, I shall devote the Essay next but one to an examination
of the account which he gives of the origin of our ideas from
sensation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may perhaps be thought, that the neglect into which Hobbes’s
metaphysical opinions have fallen was originally owing to the obloquy
excited by the misanthropy and despotical tendency of his political
writings. But it seems to me that he has been almost as hardly dealt
with in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to his principles of government, this may at least be said for
them, that they are in form and appearance very much the same with
those detailed long after in Rousseau’s ‘Social Contract,’ and evidently
suggested the plan of that work, which has never been considered as
a defence of tyranny. The author indeed requires an absolute submission
in the subject to the laws, but then it is to be in consequence
of his own consent to obey them. Every man is at least <em>supposed</em> to
be his own lawgiver.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, as to the misanthropy with which he is charged, for
having made fear the actual foundation and cement of civil society, he
has I think made his own apology very satisfactorily in these words:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>‘It may seem strange to some man that hath not well weighed
these things, that nature should thus dissociate and render men apt to
invade and destroy one another; and he may therefore, not trusting
to the inference made from the passions, desire perhaps to have the
same confirmed by experience. Let him therefore consider with
himself—when taking a journey he arms himself, and seeks to go
well accompanied; when going to sleep he locks his doors; when
even in his house, he locks his chests, and this when he knows there
be laws and public officers, armed to revenge all injuries that shall be
done him;—what opinion I say, he has of his fellow subjects when he
rides armed, of his fellow citizens when he locks his doors, and of
his children and servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not
then accuse mankind as much by his actions as I do by my words?
Yet neither of us accuse man’s nature in it.’—<cite>Leviathan</cite>, p. 62.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true the bond of civil government according to his account, is
very different from Burke’s ‘<em>soft collar of social esteem</em>,’ and takes
away the sentimental part of politics. But I confess I see nothing
liberal in this ‘order of thoughts,’ as Hobbes elsewhere expresses it,
‘the crime, the officer, the prison, the judge and the gallows,’ which
is nevertheless a good description of the nature and end of political
institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true reason of the fate which this author’s writings met with
was that his views of things were too original and comprehensive to
be immediately understood, without passing through the hands of
several successive generations of commentators and interpreters.
Ignorance of another’s meaning is a sufficient cause of fear, and fear
produces hatred: hence arose the rancour and suspicion of his
adversaries, who, to quote some fine lines of Spenser,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON LIBERTY AND NECESSITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In this Essay I shall give the best account I can of the question
concerning liberty and necessity from the writings of others, and
afterwards add a few remarks of my own on the explanation of the
terms employed in this controversy. Of Mr. Hobbes’s discourse
on this subject, I should be nearly disposed to say with Gassendi,
when another work of his, ‘De Cive,’ was presented to him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>‘This treatise, though small in bulk, is in my judgment the very
marrow of philosophy.’ In order to give a clear and satisfactory
view of the question, I shall be obliged to repeat some things I have
before stated, for which the importance of the subject as well as other
circumstances will, I hope, be a sufficient excuse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of necessity is stated by this author with great force
and precision as a general question of cause and effect, and with
scarcely any particular reference to his mechanical theory of the
mind. From this naked simple view of the matter, I cannot consistently
with truth withhold my full and entire assent. The ground-work,
the pure basis of the doctrine is in my opinion incontestable;
it cannot be denied without overturning all the rules of science, as
well as the plainest dictates of the understanding: whoever attacks
it there in its stronghold, will only injure the cause he espouses. It
is that rock upon which whoever falls will be dashed to pieces. But
though I cannot pretend to undermine the foundation, yet I may
attempt to shake some parts of the superstructure, and to clear away
the crust of materialism which has grown over it. In my opinion,
the representations which have commonly been given of the subject
by the writers on both sides of the argument are almost equally
erroneous, and their opposite conclusions built on an equal misconception
of the true principle of necessity. By the principle of
moral or philosophical necessity is meant then that the mind is invariably
governed by certain laws which determine all its operations;
or in other words, that the regular succession of cause and effect is
not confined to mere matter, while the impulses of the will are left
quite unaccounted for, self-caused, perfectly contingent and fantastical.
We in general attribute those things to chance the causes of which
we do not understand, both in mind and matter. But as there is a
greater latitude and inconstancy in the one than in the other, insomuch
that we can hardly ever predict with certainty the effect of
particular motives on the mind, the opinion of chance, arbitrary
inclination, or self-determination had gained much deeper root with
respect to the operations of mind than to those of matter. The
fallacy of this opinion Hobbes has exposed in a masterly, and I think
unanswerable manner, and without running into those paradoxical
conclusions from the first position which later necessarians have
deduced from it. He affirms that necessity is perfectly consistent
with human liberty; that is, that the most strict and inviolable connexion
of cause and effect does not prevent the full, free, and unrestrained
development of certain powers in the agent, or take away
the distinction between the nature of virtue and vice, praise and blame,
reward and punishment, but is the foundation of all moral reasoning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Except Dr. Jonathan Edwards, he is the only professed necessarian
that I know of who has not been led, by the customary use of
language, to quit the original definition of the term, and to slide from
a philosophical into a vulgar and practical necessity. But I will
state his reasoning in his own words, which are the best. They are
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘My opinion about Liberty and Necessity.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>First</em>, I conceive that when it cometh into a man’s mind to do or
not to do some certain action, if he have no time to deliberate, the
doing it or abstaining necessarily follows the present thought he hath
of the good or evil consequences thereof to himself; as, for example,
in sudden anger the action shall follow the thought of revenge; in
sudden fear, the thought of escape; also when a man hath time to
deliberate, but deliberateth not, because never any thing appeared that
could him make doubt of the consequence, the action follows his
opinion of the goodness or harm of it. These actions I call voluntary,
because these actions that <em>follow immediately</em> the last appetite are
voluntary, are here: where is only one appetite that one is the last.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Secondly</em>, I conceive when a man deliberates whether he shall do a
thing or not do it, that he does nothing else but consider whether it
be better for himself to do it or not to do it; and to consider an
action, is to imagine the consequences of it both good and evil; from
whence is to be inferred, that deliberation is nothing else but alternate
imagination of the good and evil sequels of an action, or (which is
the same thing) alternate hope and fear, or alternate appetite to do or
quit the action of which he deliberateth.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Thirdly</em>, I conceive that in all deliberations, that is to say, in all
alternate succession of contrary appetites, the last is that which we
call the will, and is immediately next before the doing of the action,
or next before the doing of it become impossible. All other
appetites to do, and to quit, that come upon a man during his deliberations,
are called intentions, and inclinations, but not wills, there being
but one will, which also in this case may be called the last will,
though the intentions change often.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Fourthly</em>, I conceive that those actions which a man is said to do
upon deliberation, are said to be voluntary, and done upon choice and
election, so that voluntary action, and action proceeding from
election is the same thing; and that of a voluntary agent, it is all
one to say, he is free, and to say, he hath not made an end of
deliberating.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Fifthly</em>, I conceive liberty to be rightly defined in this manner:
liberty is the absence of all the impediments to action that are not
contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the agent, as for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>example, the water is said to descend freely, or to have liberty to
descend by the channel of the river, because there is no impediment
that way, but not across, because the banks are impediments,
and though the water cannot ascend, yet men never say it
wants the liberty to ascend, but the faculty or power, because the
impediment is in the nature of the water, and intrinsical. So also
we say, he that is tied wants the liberty to go, because the impediment
is not in him, but in his bands; whereas we say not so
of him that is sick or lame, because the impediment is in himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Sixthly</em>, I conceive that nothing taketh beginning from itself, but
from the action of some other immediate agent without itself. And
that, therefore, when first a man hath an appetite or will to something,
to which immediately before he had no appetite nor will, the cause of
his will, is not the will itself, but something else not in his own
disposing; so that whereas it is out of controversy, that of voluntary
actions the will is the necessary cause, and by this which is said, the
will is also caused by other things whereof it disposeth not, it
followeth, that voluntary actions have all of them necessary causes,
and therefore are necessitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Seventhly</em>, I hold that to be a sufficient cause, to which nothing is
wanting that is needful to the producing of the effect. The same
also is a necessary cause. For if it be possible that a sufficient cause
shall not bring forth the effect, then there wanteth somewhat which
was needful to the producing of it, and so the cause was not sufficient;
but if it be impossible that a sufficient cause should not produce
the effect, then is a sufficient cause a necessary cause (for that
is said to produce an effect necessarily that cannot but produce it;)
hence it is manifest, that whatsoever is produced, is produced
necessarily: for whatsoever is produced hath had a sufficient cause
to produce it, or else it had not been; and therefore also voluntary
actions are necessitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>Lastly</em>, I hold that the ordinary definition of a free agent,
namely, that a free agent, is that, which, when all things are present
which are needful to produce the effect, can nevertheless not produce
it, implies a contradiction, and is nonsense; being as much as to say,
the cause may be sufficient, that is to say necessary, and yet the effect
shall not follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>My Reasons.</span>—For the first five points, wherein it is explicated—1.
what spontaneity is; 2. what deliberation is; 3. what will,
propension and appetite are; 4. what a free agent is; 5. what
liberty is; there can no other proof be offered but every man’s own
experience, by reflection on himself, and remembering what he himself
meaneth when he saith an action is spontaneous: a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>deliberates: such is his will: that agent or that action is free. Now
he that reflecteth so on himself, cannot but be satisfied, that deliberation
is the consideration of the good or evil sequels of an action to
come; that by spontaneity is meant inconsiderate action (or else
nothing is meant by it); that will is the last act of our deliberation;
that a free agent is he that can do if he will, and forbear if he will;
and that liberty is the absence of external impediments. But, to
those that out of custom speak not what they conceive, but what they
hear, and are not able, or will not take the pains to consider what
they think when they hear such words, no argument can be sufficient;
because experience and matter of fact is not verified by other
men’s arguments, but by every man’s own sense and memory. For
example, how can it be proved that to love a thing and to think it
good is all one, to a man that hath not marked his own meaning by
those words? or how can it be proved that eternity is not <i><span lang="la">nunc stans</span></i>
to a man that says those words by custom, and never considers how
he can conceive the thing in his mind? Also the sixth point, that
a man cannot imagine any thing to begin without a cause, can no other
way be made known, but by trying how he can imagine it; but if he
try, he shall find as much reason (if there be no cause of the thing)
to conceive it should begin at one time as another, that he hath equal
reason to think it should begin at all times, which is impossible, and
therefore he must think there was some special cause why it began then,
rather than sooner or later, or else that it began never, but was eternal.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘For the seventh point, which is, that all events have necessary
causes, it is there proved in that they have sufficient causes. Further,
let us in this place also suppose any event never so casual, as the
throwing (for example) “ames ace” upon a pair of dice, and see if
it must not have been necessary before it was thrown. For seeing it
was thrown, it had a beginning, and consequently a sufficient cause to
produce it, consisting partly in the dice, partly in outward things, as
the posture of the parts of the hand, the measure of force applied by
the caster, the posture of the parts of the table, and the like. In
sum, there was nothing wanting which was necessarily requisite to
the producing of that particular cast, and consequently the cast was
necessarily thrown; for if it had not been thrown, there had wanted
somewhat requisite to the throwing of it, and so the cause had not
been sufficient. In the like manner it may be proved that every
other accident, how contingent soever it seem, or how voluntary
soever it be, is produced necessarily. The same may be proved also
in this manner. Let the case be put, for example, of the weather:
’tis necessary that to-morrow it shall rain or not rain. If, therefore,
it be not necessary it shall rain, it is necessary it shall not rain, otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>there is no necessity that the proposition, it shall rain or not
rain, should be true. I know there be some that say, it may necessarily
be true that one of the two shall come to pass, but not, singly
that it shall rain, or that it shall not rain, which is as much as to say,
one of them is necessary, yet neither of them is necessary; and
therefore to seem to avoid that absurdity, they make a distinction,
that neither of them is true <em>determinate</em>, but <em>indeterminate</em>, which distinction
either signifies no more but this, one of them is true, but we
know not which, and so the necessity remains, though we know it
not; or if the meaning of the distinction be not that, it hath no
meaning, and they might as well have said, one of them is true
<em>titirice</em>, but neither of them, <i><span lang="la">tu patulice</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The last thing in which also consisteth the whole controversy,
namely, that there is no such thing as an agent, which when all
things requisite to action are present, can nevertheless forbear to produce
it; or (which is all one) that there is no such thing as freedom
from necessity, is easily inferred from that which hath been before
alleged. For if it be an agent it can work, and if it work there is
nothing wanting of what is requisite to produce the action, and consequently
the cause of the action is sufficient, and if sufficient, then
also necessary, as hath been proved before. And thus you see how
the inconveniences, which it is objected must follow upon the holding
of necessity, are avoided, and the necessity itself demonstratively
proved. To which I could add, if I thought it good logic, the
inconvenience of denying necessity, as that it destroyeth both the
decrees and the prescience of God Almighty; for whatsoever God
hath purposed to bring to pass by man, as an instrument, or foreseeth
shall come to pass; a man, if he have liberty as hath been affirmed
from necessitation, might frustrate, and make not to come to pass, and
God should either not foreknow it, and not decree it, or he should
foreknow such things shall be, as shall never be, and decree that
which shall never come to pass. This is all that hath come into my
mind touching this question since I last considered it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The letter from which the foregoing extract is taken is addressed
to the Marquis of Newcastle, and dated at Rouen in 1651, twenty
years before the publication of Spinoza’s most exact and beautiful
demonstration of the same principle. Some of Hobbes’s antagonists
had charged him with having borrowed his arguments from Marsennus,
a French author; to which in one of his controversial tracts
Hobbes replies with some contempt, that this Marsennus had heard
him talk on the subject when he was in Paris, and had borrowed
them from him. Dr. Priestley has done justice to Hobbes on this
question of necessity, and I suspect more than justice in denying that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the Stoics were acquainted with the same principle. At any rate,
the modern commentators on the subject (and Dr. Priestley among
them) have added nothing to it but absurdities, from which our
author’s logic protected him; for he seldom reasoned wrong but
when he reasoned from wrong premises. As this question is one of
the most interesting in the history of philosophy, I shall perhaps be
excused for adding one more extract (of considerable length) to
prove that Hobbes is not, in this instance, chargeable with the practical
inferences which have been made from his doctrine. In answer
to the objections of Bishop Bramhall, with whom he had a controversy
on the subject, he says:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Of the arguments from reason, the first is that which his Lordship
saith is drawn from Zeno’s beating of his man, which is therefore
called <em>Argumentum Baculinum</em>, that is to say, a wooden argument.
The story is this: Zeno held that all actions were necessary: his
man therefore being for some fault beaten, excused himself upon the
necessity of it: to avoid this excuse, his master pleaded likewise the
necessity of beating him. So that not he that maintained, but he
that derided the necessity was beaten, contrary to that his Lordship
would infer.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The second argument is taken from certain inconveniences which
his Lordship thinks would follow such an opinion.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The first inconvenience, he says, is this, that the laws which
prohibit any action will be unjust.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘2. That all consultations are vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘3. That admonitions to men of understanding are of no more use
than to children, fools, and madmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘4. That praise, dispraise, reward and punishment are in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘5 and 6. That counsels, arts, arms, books, instruments, study,
tutors, medicines are in vain.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Hobbes’s answer to these conclusions is I think quite satisfactory.
He says—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘To which arguments his Lordship, expecting I should answer by
saying, “the ignorance of the event were enough to make us use the
means,” adds (as it were a reply to my answer foreseen) these words,
“<em>Alas! how should our not knowing the event be a sufficient motive to
make us use the means?</em>” Wherein his Lordship says right: but my
answer is not that which he expecteth. I answer:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘First, that the necessity of an action doth not make the laws that
prohibit it unjust. To let pass that not the necessity, but the will to
break the law maketh the action unjust, because the law regardeth the
will and no other antecedent cause of action, and to let pass that no
law can possibly be unjust, inasmuch as every man maketh (by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>consent) the law he is bound to keep, and which consequently must
be just, unless a man can be unjust to himself;—I say, what necessary
cause soever precede an action, yet if the action be forbidden, he that
doth it willingly may be justly punished. For instance, suppose the
law on pain of death prohibit stealing, and that there be a man who
by the strength of temptation is necessitated to steal, and is thereupon
put to death, does not this punishment deter others from stealing?
Is it not a cause that others steal not? Doth it not frame and make
their wills to justice? To make the law is therefore to make a cause
of justice, and to necessitate justice, and consequently ’tis no injustice
to make such a law. The intention of the law is not to grieve the
delinquent for what is past and not to be undone; but to make him
and others just that else would not be so; and respecteth not the evil
act past, but the good to come. Insomuch as without the good intention
for the future, no past act of a delinquent would justify his killing
in the sight of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Secondly, I deny that it maketh consultations to be vain. ’Tis
the consultation that causeth a man and necessitateth him to choose
to do one thing rather than another: so that unless a man say that
that cause is in vain which necessitateth the effect, he cannot infer
the superfluousness of consultation out of the necessity of the election
proceeding from it. But it seemeth his Lordship reasons thus: “If I
must do this rather than that, I shall do it though I consult not at all;”
which is a false proposition and a false consequence, and no better than
this: “If I shall live till to-morrow, I shall live till to-morrow, though I
run myself through with a sword to-day.” If there be a necessity that
an action shall be done, or that any effect shall be brought to pass, it
does not therefore follow that there is nothing necessarily requisite as
a means to bring it to pass; and therefore when it is determined that
one thing shall be chosen before another, ’tis determined also for
what cause it shall be chosen, which cause for the most part is
deliberation or consultation; and therefore consultation is not in vain,
and indeed the less in vain by how much the election is more
necessitated, if <em>more</em> and <em>less</em> had any place in necessity.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The same answer is to be given to the third supposed inconvenience,
namely, that admonitions are in vain: for admonitions are
parts of consultation, the admonitor being a counsellor for the time to
him that is admonished.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The fourth pretended inconvenience is, that praise, dispraise,
reward and punishment will be in vain. To which I answer, that
for praise and dispraise, they depend not at all on the necessity of the
action praised or dispraised. For what is it else to praise, but to say
a thing is good; good, I say, for me or for some body else, or for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the state and commonwealth? And what is it to say an action is
good, but to say it is as I would wish, or as another would have it,
or according to the will of the state, that is to say, according to the
law. Does my Lord think that no action can please me or him or
the commonwealth, that should proceed from necessity? Things
may therefore be necessary, and yet praiseworthy, as also necessary,
and yet dispraised, and neither of them both in vain, because praise
and dispraise, and likewise reward and punishment, do by example
make and conform the will to good and evil. It was a very great
praise in my opinion that Velleius Paterculus gives Cato, when he
says that he was good by nature, <i><span lang="la">et quia aliter esse non potuit</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘To the last objection, that counsels, arts, arms, instruments,
books, study, medicines, and the like would be superfluous, the same
answer serves as to the former, that is to say, that this consequence,
<em>if the effect shall come to pass, then it shall come to pass without its
causes</em>, is a false one, and those things named counsels, arts, arms,
&#38;c. are the causes of those effects.’—Page 291.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘His Lordship’s third argument consisteth in other inconveniences,
which he saith will follow, namely, impiety, and negligence of
religious duties, as repentance and zeal to God’s service, &#38;c. To
which I answer as to the rest, that they follow not. I must confess,
if we consider the greatest part of mankind, not as they should be,
but as they are, that is, as men whom either the study of acquiring
wealth or preferment, or whom the appetite of sensual delights or the
impatience of meditation, or the rash embracing of wrong principles
have made unapt to discuss the truth of things; I must, I say,
confess that the dispute of this question will rather hurt than help
their piety, and therefore if his Lordship had not desired this answer,
I should not have written it, nor do I write it but in hopes your
Lordship and his will keep it private. Nevertheless in very truth,
the necessity of events does not of itself draw with it any impiety at
all. For piety consisteth only in two things: one that we honour
God in our hearts, which is, that we think as highly of his power as
we can, (for to honour any thing is nothing else but to think it to be
of great power). The other is that we signify that honour and
esteem by our words and actions, which is called <i><span lang="la">cultus</span></i>, or worship
of God. He therefore that thinketh that all things proceed from
God’s eternal will, and consequently are necessary, does he not think
God omnipotent? Does he not esteem of his power as highly as is
possible, which is to honour God as much as may be in his heart?
Again, he that thinketh so, is he not more apt by external acts and
words to acknowledge it, than he that thinketh otherwise? Yet is
this external acknowledgment the same thing which we call worship;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>so that this opinion fortifies piety in both kinds, external and internal,
and therefore is far from destroying it. And for repentance, which
is nothing else but a glad returning into the right way, after the grief
of being out of the way, though the cause that made him go astray
were necessary, yet there is no reason why he should not grieve;
and, again, though the cause why he returned into the way were
necessary, there remaineth still the cause of joy. So that the
necessity of the acting taketh away neither of those parts of repentance—grief
for the error, and joy for returning.’—<cite>Tripos</cite>, p. 292.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author afterwards properly defines a moral agent to be one
that acts from deliberation, choice, or will, not from indifference;
and, speaking of the supposed inconsistency between choice and
necessity, adds:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Commonly when we see and know the strength that moves us,
we acknowledge necessity; but when we see not or mark not the
force that moves us, we then think there is none, and that it is not
causes but liberty that produceth the action. Hence it is that they
think he doth not choose this that of necessity chooses it, but they
might as well say, fire doth not burn, because it burns of necessity.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The general question is thus stated by Mr. Hobbes in the beginning
of his treatise: the point is not, he says, ‘whether a man can be a
free agent; that is to say, whether he can write or forbear, speak or
be silent, according to his will, but whether the will to write, and the
will to forbear, come upon him according to his will, or according to
any thing else in his own power. I acknowledge this liberty, that
I can do if I will; but to say—I can will if I will, I take to be an
absurd speech. In fine, that freedom which men commonly find in
books, that which the poets chaunt in the theatres, and the shepherds
on the mountains, that which the pastors teach in the pulpits, and the
doctors in the universities, and that which the common people in the
markets, and all mankind in the whole world do assent unto, is the
same that I assent unto, namely, that a man hath freedom to do if he
will, but whether he hath freedom to will is a question neither the
bishop nor they ever thought on.’</p>

<p class='c007'>All in which I differ from Hobbes is, that I think there is a real
freedom of choice and will, as well as of action, in the sense of the
author, that is, not a freedom from necessity or causes in either case,
but a liberty in any given agent to exert certain powers without
being controlled or impeded in their exercise by another agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Helvetius says, ‘It is true we can form a tolerably distinct idea of
the word <em>liberty</em>, understood in a common sense. A man is free who
is neither loaded with irons, nor confined in prison, nor intimidated
like the slave by the dread of chastisement: in this sense, the liberty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>of a man consists in the free exercise of his power: I say of his
power, because it would be ridiculous to mistake for a want of liberty
the incapacity we are under to pierce the clouds like the eagle, to live
under the water like the whale, or to become king, emperor, or pope.
We have so far a sufficiently clear idea of the word. But this is no
longer the case when we come to apply liberty to the will. What
must this liberty then mean? We can only understand by it a free
power of willing or not willing a thing: but this power would imply that
there may be a will without motives, and consequently an effect without
a cause. A philosophical treatise on the liberty of the will would
be a treatise of effects without a cause.’—<cite>Helvetius on the Mind</cite>, p. 44.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I cannot perceive why there is any more difficulty in annexing
a meaning to the word liberty, as it relates to the faculties of the mind
than as it relates to those of the body, or why a treatise of the one
should be a treatise of effects without a cause any more than of the
other. If the distinction between liberty and necessity is lost in this
case, it is not because liberty but because necessity can have no place
in the will, or because we cannot easily put a padlock on the mind.
If the prisoner who has his chains struck off, walks or runs, dances
or leaps, is this an instance of an effect without a cause, because it is
an effect of liberty, or of what Helvetius calls the free exercise of
his power? Not that he can exert this power without means or
motives, that is, without ground to move on, or limbs to move with,
or breath to draw, or will to impel him, but ‘with all these means
and appliances to boot’ he has a power to do certain things which
his chains deprived him of the liberty of doing, but which the striking
them off restores to him again. Why then, if liberty does not in its
common sense signify an effect without a cause, but the free exercise
of a power, did it not signify the same thing or something similar as
applied to the mind? Has the mind no powers, or are they necessarily
impeded and hindered from operating? My notion of a free agent,
I confess, is not that represented by Mr. Hobbes, namely, one that
when all things necessary to produce the effect are present can nevertheless
not produce it; but I believe a free agent of whatever kind,
is one which where all things necessary to produce the effect are
present, can produce it; its own operation not being hindered by any
thing else. The body is said to be free when it has the power to obey
the direction of the will: so the will may be said to be free when it has
the power to obey the dictates of the understanding. The absurdity of
the libertarians is in supposing that liberty of action, and liberty of will
have the same identical source, viz. the will; or that as it is the will that
moves the body, so it is the will that moves itself in order to be free.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke’s chapter ‘On Power,’ in the first volume of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Essay, contains his account of liberty and necessity, and has been
more found fault with than any other part of his work; I think
without reason. He seems evidently to have admitted the definition
of necessity, though he has avoided the name, which is not much to
be wondered at, considering the misconception to which it is liable,
and which can scarcely be separated from it in the closest reasoning,
much less as a term of general signification. In other words, he
denies the power of the mind to act without a cause or motive, or,
in any manner in any circumstances, from mere indifferency and
absolute self motion; but he at the same time rejects the inference
which has been drawn from this principle, that the mind is not an
agent at all, but entirely subject to external force or blind impulse.
What he has said is little more than an expansion of Hobbes’s general
description of practical liberty, ‘that it is a power to do, if we will.’
Thus, according to Mr. Locke, it would not be so absurd to give a
restive horse the spur or the whip to make him go straight forward
on a plain road, as it would be in order to make him leap up a
precipice a hundred feet high. The one the horse has a power or
liberty to do if he will, the other he has no power to do at any rate.
That is, here are two sorts of impediments, one that may be overcome,
and which it is right to take means to overcome, and another
which cannot be overcome, and which it is therefore absurd to
meddle with. To say that these two necessities are in effect the
same, is an abuse of language; yet for not lumping them together in
the dashing style of our modern wholesale dealers in paradox, Mr.
Locke has been made the subject of endless abuse and contumely.
The difference between them, as stated by this author with great
force and earnestness of feeling, in truth constitutes all that men in
general mean when they talk of freedom of will, and make it, as in
this sense it is, the ground-work of morality. There are certain
powers which the mind has of governing not only the actions of the
body, but of regulating its own thoughts and desires, and it is to
make us exert these powers that all the distinctions, rules and
sanctions of morality have been established. It must be ridiculous
to attempt to make us do, what upon the face of the thing it was
known we could not do; yet it is on this literal and unqualified
interpretation of the term, as implying a flat impossibility of the contrary,
an utter incapacity and helplessness in the mind, a concurrence
of causes foreign to the will itself, and irresistible in their effect, and
with which it must therefore be in vain to contend, that most of the
consequences from the doctrine of necessity have been built; such
as that reward and punishment are absurd and improper, that virtue
and vice are words without a meaning, that the assassin is no more a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>moral or accountable agent than the dagger which he uses, and many
others of the same stamp. The sword and the assassin would be
equally moral and accountable agents, if they were both equally
accessible to moral motives, that is, to reward and punishment,
praise and blame, &#38;c.; but they are not. This seems to be a
distinction of great pith and moment. It is said to be a mere
difference of words; at least it makes all the difference whether such
motives as reward and punishment, praise and blame, should be
applied or not, and this one should think was a difference of practice.
It is objected, indeed, that still both are equally necessary agents.
But this appears to me to be a confusion of words. It is in vain to
exhort flame not to burn, or to be angry with poison for working:
and it would be equally in vain to exhort men to certain actions or to
resent others, if exhortation and resentment had no more effect upon
them, that is, if they were really governed by the same sort of blind,
physical, unreasoning, unresisting necessity. In fact, the latest
necessarians have abandoned the true, original, philosophical meaning
of the term, in which it implies no more than the connection between
cause and effect, and have substituted for it the prejudiced notion of their
adversaries, who confound it with mechanical necessity, ‘fixed fate,
foreknowledge absolute,’ or the unconditional <i><span lang="la">fiat</span></i> of omnipotence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following extracts which I shall condense as much as I can
consistently with the nature of the argument, will shew the view which
Mr. Locke has taken of this subject. I would only observe, by the by,
that I so far agree with Hobbes and differ from Mr. Locke, in thinking
that liberty in the most extended and abstract sense is applicable
to material as well as voluntary agents; moral liberty, <em>i.e.</em> freedom
of will evidently is not, because such agents have no such faculty.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘All the actions that we have any idea of,’ says my author, ‘reducing
themselves to these two, <em>viz.</em> thinking and moving, so far as a
man has a power to think or not to think, to move or not to move,
according to the preference or direction of his own mind, so far is a
man free. Wherever any performance or forbearance are not equally
in a man’s power, wherever doing or not doing will not equally follow
upon the preference of his mind, directing it, there he is not free,
though perhaps the action may be voluntary. Where any particular
action is not in the power of the agent, to be produced by him according
to his volition, there he is not at liberty; that agent is under
necessity. So that liberty cannot be where there is no thought, no
volition, no will; but there may be thought, there may be volition,
there may be will, where there is no liberty. A little consideration
of an obvious instance or two may make this clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘A tennis-ball, whether in motion by the stroke of a racket, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>lying still at rest, is not by any one taken to be a free agent. If we
inquire into the reason, we shall find it is because we conceive not a
tennis-ball to think; and consequently not to have any volition, or preference
of motion to rest or <i><span lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>; and therefore has not liberty,
is not a free agent, but both its motion and rest come under our idea of
necessity, and are so called. Likewise a man falling into the water (a
bridge breaking under him) has not herein liberty, is not a free agent.
For though he has volition, though he prefers his not falling to falling,
yet the forbearance of that motion not being in his power, the stop or
cessation of that motion follows not upon his volition; and therefore
therein he is not free. So a man striking himself or his friend by a
convulsive motion of his arm, no body thinks he has in this liberty,
every one pities him as acting by necessity and constraint.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Here I will just stop to observe that the stanch sticklers for
necessity, who make up by an excess of zeal for their want of knowledge,
would read this passage with a smile of self-complacent contempt,
and remark profoundly that whether the man struck his friend
on purpose, or from a convulsive motion, he was equally under
necessity, and the object of pity. Now whether he is an object
of pity, I shall not dispute; but I conceive he is also an object of
anger in the one case which he is not in the other, because anger
will prevent a man’s striking you again, but will not cure him of
St. Vitus’s dance. It is to this sort of indiscriminate, blind, senseless
necessity which neutralizes all things and actions, and under the pretence
of establishing the operation of causes, destroys the distinction
between the different degrees and kinds of necessity, to which I do not
profess myself a convert.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return.—‘As it is in the motions of the body,’ proceeds Mr.
Locke, ‘so it is in the thoughts of our minds: where any one is such,
that we have power to take it up or lay it by, according to the preference
of the mind, there we are at liberty. Yet some ideas to the mind,
like some motions to the body, are such as in certain circumstances it
cannot avoid, nor obtain their absence by the utmost effort it can use.
A man on the rack is not at liberty to lay by the idea of pain, and
divert himself with other contemplations. And sometimes a boisterous
passion hurries our thoughts, as a hurricane does our bodies,
without leaving us the liberty of thinking on other things which we
would rather choose. But as soon as the mind regains the power to
stop or continue, begin or forbear any of these motions of the body
without, or of the mind within, according as it thinks fit to prefer
either to the other, we then consider the man as free again.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But freedom,’ says my author, ‘unless it reaches farther than this,
will not serve the turn; and it passes for a good plea that a man is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>not free at all, if he is not as free to will, as he is to act what he wills.
Concerning a man’s liberty, there yet therefore is raised this farther
question, whether a man be free to will? And as to that I imagine
that a man in respect of willing, when any action in his power is once
proposed to his thoughts as presently [that is, immediately] to be
done, cannot be free. The reason whereof is very manifest; for it
being unavoidable that the action depending on his will should exist
or not exist, and its existence or non-existence following perfectly the
determination of his will, he cannot avoid willing the existence or
non-existence of that action; it is absolutely necessary that he will the
one, or the other, <em>i.e.</em> prefer the one to the other, since one of them
must necessarily follow.’—Page 246.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seems to be the weak part of Mr. Locke’s reasoning, and is
the only place, as I remember, where he has considered the certainty of
the event as inconsistent with the practical liberty for which he contends.
At this rate, it must be given up altogether: there can be no
such thing as liberty. For in all cases whatever, one determination
must happen rather than another. In all cases whatever, we must
choose either one way or another, or suspend our choice. Suspense and
deliberation, as Helvetius and others have justly remarked, are in this
sense equally necessary with precipitation of judgment. The actual
or final event is in both cases the necessary consequence of preceding
causes, but that does not destroy freedom of choice in either case, if
the event depends upon the exercise of choice, whether the time
allowed for the mind to choose in, be longer or shorter. If by liberty
be meant the uncertainty of the event, then liberty is a nonentity:
but if it be supposed to relate to the concurrence of certain powers of
an agent in the production of that event, then it is as true and as real
a thing as the necessity to which it is thus opposed, and which consists
in the exclusion of certain powers possessed by an agent from operating
in the producing of any event. At the same time it must be granted,
that the power of deliberation is the most valuable privilege of our
rational nature, and the great enlargement of the discursive faculty of
the will. Mr. Locke seems only to have erred in mistaking a difference
of degree or extent for one of kind. The practical truth of the
distinction is undeniable. His words are:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The mind having in most cases, as is evident from experience, a
power to suspend the execution and satisfaction of any of its desires,
and so all, one after another, is at liberty to consider the objects of
them, examine them on all sides, and weigh them with others. In
this lies the liberty man has; and from the not using of it right comes
all that variety of mistakes, errors, and faults, which we run into in
the conduct of our lives, and our endeavours after happiness: whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>we precipitate the determination of our wills, and engage too soon
before due examination. For during the suspension of any desire,
before the will be determined to action, we have an opportunity to
examine, view, and judge of the good or evil of what we are going to
do; and when upon due examination we have judged, we have done
our duty, all that we can or ought to do, in pursuit of our happiness;
and it is not a fault, but a perfection of our nature, to desire, will, and
act, according to the last result of a fair examination. This seems to
me the source of all liberty; in this seems to consist that which is (I
think improperly) called <em>free-will</em>.’—<cite>Essay</cite>, vol. i. p. 264.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moral liberty, it should seem then, all the liberty which a man has
or which he wants, does not after all consist in a power of indifferency,
or in a power of choosing, without regard to motives, but in a power
of exciting his reason and of obeying it. There are two general
positions advanced by the author in the course of this inquiry, to
neither of which I can agree; namely, that action always proceeds
from uneasiness, and that we are perfect judges of present good and
evil. With respect to the first, it is true indeed that nothing can be
an object of desire till we suffer uneasiness from the want of it, but it
is just as true, that the want of any thing does not cause uneasiness in
the mind, unless it is first an object of desire, or unless the prospect of
it gives us pleasure. As to the second position, that we cannot be
deceived in judging of our actual sensations, it would be true, if the
sensation and the judgment formed upon it were the same, but they
neither are nor can be. Let any person smell to a rose, and look at
a beautiful prospect or hear a fine piece of music at the same instant,
and try to determine which of them gives him most pleasure. If
he has the least doubt or hesitation, the principle laid down by
Mr. Locke cannot pass for an axiom. From not accurately distinguishing
between sensation and judgment, some writers have been led to
confound good and evil with pleasure and pain. Good or evil is
properly that which gives the mind pleasure or pain on reflection,
that is, which excites rational approbation or disapprobation. To
consider these two things as either the same or in any regular proportion
to each other, is I think to betray a very superficial acquaintance
with human nature. Yet in defiance of the necessary distinction
between the faculties by which we feel and by which we judge, these
moralists have laid it down as a fundamental rule that all pleasures
which are so in themselves are equally good and commendable; yet
as these ideas relate solely to the reflex impression made by certain
things on the understanding, to insist that we shall judge of them by
an appeal to the senses, is unwisely to overturn the principle of the
division of labour among our faculties, and to force one to do the office
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of another. For this there seems no more reason than for attempting
to hear with our fingers, to see a sound, or feel a colour.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Yet the absurdity of the attempt arises only from the inaptitude of
the organ to the object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among simple ideas Mr. Locke reckons that of power. It were
to be wished that he had given it as simple a source as possible, viz.
the feeling we have of it in our own minds, which he sometimes seems
half inclined to do, instead of referring it to our observation of the
successive changes which take place in matter. It is by this means
alone, that is, by making it an original idea derived from within, like
the sense of pleasure or pain, and quite distinct from the visible
composition and decomposition of other objects, that we can avoid
being driven into an absolute scepticism with regard to cause and
effect. For Hume has, I think, demonstrated that in the mere
mechanical series of sensible appearances, there is nothing to suggest
this idea, or point out the indissoluble connection of one event with
another, any more than in the flies of a summer. We get this idea
solely from the exertion of muscular or voluntary power in ourselves:
whoever has stretched forth his hand to an object, must have the idea
of power. Under the idea of power I include all that relates to what
we call force, energy, weakness, effort, ease, difficulty, impossibility, &#38;c.
Accordingly, I should conceive that no man of strong passions, or
great muscular activity would ever give up the idea of power. Hume,
who seems to have discarded it with the least compunction, was
an easy, indolent, good-tempered man, who did not care to stir out of
his arm-chair; a languid, Epicurean philosopher, of a reasonable
corpulency, who was hurried away by no violent passions, or intense
desires, but looked on most things with the same eye of listlessness
and indifference. He was one of the subtlest and most metaphysical
of all metaphysicians. And perhaps he was so for the reason here
stated. The Scotch in general are not metaphysicians: they have
in fact always a purpose, they aim at a particular point, they are
determined upon something beforehand. This gives a hardness and
rigidity to their understandings, and takes away that tremulous sensibility
to every slight and wandering impression which is necessary to
complete the fine balance of the mind, and enable us to follow all the
infinite fluctuations of thought through their nicest distinctions.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to the doctrine of necessity. I shall refer to the
authority of but one more writer, who has indeed exhausted the
subject, and anticipated what few remarks I had to offer upon it: I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>mean Jonathan Edwards, in his treatise on the Will. This work,
setting aside its Calvinistic tendency with which I have nothing to
do, is one of the most closely reasoned, elaborate, acute, serious, and
sensible among modern productions. No metaphysician can read it
without feeling a wish to have been the author of it. The gravity of
the matter and the earnestness of the manner are alike admirable.
His reasoning is not of that kind, which consists in having a smart
answer for every trite objection, but in attaining true and satisfactory
solutions of things perceived in all their difficulty and in all their
force, and in every variety of connexion. He evidently writes to
satisfy his own mind and the minds of those, who like himself are
intent upon the pursuit of truth for its own sake. There is not an
evasion or ambiguity in his whole book, nor a wish to produce any
but thorough conviction. He does not therefore lead his readers into
a labyrinth of words, or entangle them among the forms of logic, or
mount the airy heights of abstraction, but descends into the plain, and
mingles with the business and feelings of mankind, and grapples with
common sense, and subdues it to the force of true reason. All
philosophy depends no less on deep and real feeling than on power of
thought. I happen to have Edwards’s ‘Inquiry concerning Freewill,’
and Dr. Priestley’s ‘Illustrations of Philosophical Necessity,’ bound
up in the same volume: and I confess that the difference in the
manner of these two writers is rather striking. The plodding, persevering,
scrupulous accuracy of the one, and the easy, cavalier, verbal
fluency of the other, form a complete contrast. Dr. Priestley’s
whole aim seems to be to evade the difficulties of his subject,
Edwards’s to answer them. The one is employed according to
Berkeley’s allegory, in flinging dust in the eyes of his adversaries,
while the other is taking true pains in digging into the mine of
knowledge. All Dr. Priestley’s arguments on this subject are mere
hackneyed common-places. He had in reality no opinion of his own,
and truth, I conceive, never takes very deep root in those minds on
which it is merely engrafted. He uniformly adopted the vantage
ground of every question, and borrowed those arguments which he
found most easy to be wielded, and of most service in that kind of
busy intellectual warfare to which he was habituated. He was an
able controversialist, not a philosophical reasoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Priestley states in his ‘Illustrations’ and in his letter to Dr.
Horsley, that the difference between physical and moral necessity is
merely verbal. He says, speaking of the connexion between cause
and effect in the mind, ‘Give me the thing and I will readily give up
the name.’ It appears to me that Dr. Priestley was quite as much
attached to the name as to the thing, and that the philosophical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>principle of necessity, without its unpopular title, would have
afforded him but little satisfaction. Now the obnoxiousness of the
name, and in my opinion, almost all the difficulty and repugnance
which the generality of men find in admitting the doctrine arises from
the ambiguity lurking under the term necessity, which includes both
kinds of necessity, moral and physical, and with which Dr. Priestley
delights to probe the prejudices of his adversaries, thinking the
differences of moral and physical necessity a mere question of words,
and that provided there are any laws or any causes operating upon
the mind, it is of no sort of consequence what those laws or causes
are. It is the same inability to distinguish between one cause and
another which creates the vulgar prejudice against necessity, and
which is exposed in a very satisfactory manner by the author of the
‘Inquiry into the Will.’ He says, in a letter written expressly to
vindicate himself from having confounded moral with physical
necessity, ‘On the contrary, I have largely declared that the
connexion between antecedent things and consequent ones which
takes place with regard to the acts of men’s wills, which is called
moral necessity, is called by the name of <em>necessity</em> improperly; and
that all such terms as <em>must</em>, <em>cannot</em>, <em>impossible</em>, <em>unable</em>, <em>irresistible</em>,
<em>unavoidable</em>, <em>invincible</em>, &#38;c. when applied here, are not applied in their
proper signification, and are either used nonsensically, and with perfect
insignificance, or in a sense quite diverse from their original and proper
meaning, and their use in common speech; and that such a necessity
as attends the acts of men’s wills, is more properly called <em>certainty</em>
than <em>necessity</em>. I think it is evidently owing to a strong prejudice in
persons’ minds, arising from an insensible habitual perversion and
misapplication of such-like terms, that they are ready to think that to
suppose a certain connexion of men’s volitions without any foregoing
motives or inclinations, is truly and properly to suppose such a strong
irrefragable chain of causes and effects as stands in the way of, and
makes utterly vain, opposite desires and endeavours, like immovable
and impenetrable mountains of brass; and impedes our liberty like
walls of adamant, gates of brass, and bars of iron: whereas all such
representations suggest ideas as far from the truth, as the East is from
the West. I know it is in vain to endeavour to make some persons
believe this, or at least fully and steadily to believe it: for if it be
demonstrated to them, still the old prejudice remains, which has been
long fixed by the use of the terms <em>necessary</em>, <em>must</em>, &#38;c. the association
with these terms of certain ideas, inconsistent with liberty, is not
broken, and the judgment is powerfully warped by it; as a thing that
has been long bent and grown stiff, if it be straightened, will return to
its former curvity again and again.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The reasoning in the ‘Inquiry’ to which the author here refers, in
justification of himself, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Men in their first use of such phrases as these, <em>must</em>, <em>cannot</em>,
<em>unavoidable</em>, <em>irresistible</em>, &#38;c. use them to signify a necessity of constraint
or restraining a natural necessity or impossibility, or some
necessity that the will has nothing to do in. A thing is said to be
<em>necessary</em>, when we cannot help it, let us do what we will. So any
thing is said to be <em>impossible</em> to us, when we would do it, or would
have it brought to pass and endeavour it, but all our desires and
endeavours are in vain. And that is said to be <em>irresistible</em>, which
overcomes all our opposition, resistance and endeavour to the contrary.
And we are said to be <em>unable</em> to do a thing, when our utmost
supposable desires and endeavours to do it are insufficient. All men
find, and begin to find in early childhood, that there are innumerable
things which cannot be done which they desire to do; and innumerable
things, which they are averse to, that must be; they cannot avoid
them, whether they choose them or no. It is to express this
necessity which men so soon and so often find, and which so greatly
affects them in innumerable cases, that such terms and phrases are
first formed; and it is to signify such a necessity that they are first
used, and that they are most constantly used in the common affairs of
life; and not to signify any such metaphysical, speculative and abstract
notion as that connexion [between cause and effect] in the nature and
course of things, to signify which they who employ themselves in
philosophical inquiries into the first origin and metaphysical relations
and dependencies of things, have borrowed those terms, for want
of others. But we grow up from our cradles in a use of such phrases
entirely different from this, or from the one in which they are
used in the controversy about liberty and necessity. And it being a
dictate of the universal sense of mankind, evident to us as soon as we
begin to think, that the necessity signified by these terms in the sense
in which we first learn them, does excuse persons, and free them from
all fault or blame, hence our idea of excusableness or faultlessness is
tied to these phrases by a strong habit, which grows up with us;—or
if we use the words as terms of art in another sense, yet unless we
are exceeding circumspect and wary, we shall insensibly slide into the
vulgar use of them, and so apply the words in a very inconsistent
manner: this habitual connexion of ideas will deceive and confound
us in our reasonings and discourses whenever we pretend to use the
terms in that manner.’—Pages 20, 21, 290, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘It follows that when the aforesaid terms are used in cases wherein
no opposition, or insufficient will or endeavour is or can be supposed,
but the very nature of the supposed case (as that of willing or choosing)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>excludes any such opposition, will, or endeavour, these terms are
then not used in their proper signification, but quite beside their use
in common speech.’—Pages 21, 22.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has, I think, in these passages, laid open the source of
most of the confusion on the subject in question. For this double
meaning lurking under the word necessity has been the chief reason
why persons, who were guided more by their own feelings and the
customary associations of language than by formal definitions, have
altogether rejected the doctrine; while persons of a more logical turn,
who could not deny the truth of the abstract principle, have yet in
their explanations of it, and inferences from it, fallen into the same
vulgar error as their opponents. The partisans for necessity have
given up their common sense, as they supposed, to their reason, while
the advocates for liberty rejected a demonstrable truth from a dread
of its consequences; and both have been the dupes of a word. I
have been the more ready to appeal to this writer’s authority, because
he is allowed on all hands to be one of the most strict, severe, and
logical of all necessarians. What he has said on the subject of free-will,
as consisting in perfect contingence, independent of all motive, or
as implying an absolute beginning of action without any precedent
determining cause might, one would imagine, have been sufficient,
even if Hobbes’s reasonings had not, to banish that opinion out of the
world. He has followed it through all its windings, and detected
it in all its varying shades, with equal patience and sagacity. He
sums up the absurdities of this notion of liberty, or of mere absolute
self-will, in these words:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The following things are all essential to it, viz. that an action
should be necessary, and not necessary; that it should be from a
cause and no cause; that it should be the fruit of choice and design,
and not the fruit of choice and design; that it should be the beginning
of motion and exertion, and yet be consequent on previous
exertion; that it should be before it is; that it should spring immediately
out of indifference and equilibrium, and yet be the effect of
preponderation; that it should be self-originated, also have its original
from something else; that it is what the mind causes itself, of its own
will, and can produce or prevent, according to its choice, or pleasure,
and yet what the mind has no power to prevent, precluding all previous
choice in the affair. So that an act of the will [determining
itself by its own free-will], according to their metaphysical account
of it, is something of which there is no idea, it is nothing but a confusion
of the mind, excited by words without any distinct meaning.
If some learned philosopher, who had been abroad, in giving an
account of the curious observations he had made in his travels, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>say, “He had been in Tierra del Fuego, and there had seen an animal,
which he calls by a certain name, that begat and brought forth itself,
and yet had a sire and a dam distinct from itself; that it had an
appetite and was hungry before it had a being; that his master, who
led him, and governed him at his pleasure, was always governed by
him, and driven by him where he pleased: that when he moved, he
always took a step before the first step; that he went with his head
first, and yet always went tail foremost; and this though he had
neither head nor tail;” it would be no impudence at all to tell such a
traveller, though a learned man, that he himself had no notion or idea
of such an animal as he gave an account of, and never had, nor ever
would have.’—Page 281, of the <cite>Inquiry</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author seems to have hit upon the source of this erroneous
account of free-will, with his usual truth of feeling. He says, almost
immediately after:—‘The thing which has led men into this inconsistent
notion of action, when applied to volition, as though it were
essential to this internal action that the agent should be self-determined
in it, and that the will should be the cause of it, was probably this:
that according to the sense of mankind, and the common use of
language, it is so with respect to men’s external actions; which are
what originally, and according to the vulgar use and most proper
sense of the word, are called <em>actions</em>. Men in these are self-directed,
self-determined, and their wills are the cause of the motions of their
bodies, and the external things that are done; so that unless men do
them voluntarily, and of choice, and the action be determined by
their antecedent volition, it is no action or doing of theirs. Hence
some metaphysicians have been led unwarily, but exceeding absurdly,
to suppose the same concerning volition itself, <em>that</em> that also must be
determined by the will; which is to be determined by antecedent
volition, as the motion of the body is; not considering the contradiction
it implies.’—<cite>Ibid.</cite>, page 286.</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall proceed to state as briefly as I can my own notions of liberty
and necessity, as far as they any way differ from the foregoing account.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, then, I conceive that if by necessity be understood and only
understood the connexion of cause and effect, or the constant
dependence of one thing on another, in the human mind as well as in
matter, that according to this interpretation all things are equally
certain and necessary. On the other hand, if by liberty be meant
any thing opposite to this connexion of cause and effect: that is, a
positive beginning of any action or motion out of nothing, or out of a
state of indifference, or from itself, I believe that there is no such
thing as liberty in the mind any more than in matter. All things
have their preceding determining causes, and nothing is, but what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>must be in the precise given circumstances. This has been demonstrated
over and over again, and the contrary supposition reduced to
a manifest absurdity in every possible way by Hobbes, Hume,
Hartley, Edwards, Priestley, and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, secondly, I conceive that the question does not stop here,
because certain ideas have been annexed to these terms of liberty and
necessity, both by the learned and by common men, which have
nothing at all to do with the affirmation or denial of the simple connexion
between cause and effect. What I shall therefore attempt
will be to point out a few instances of the misapplication of the term
to prove a necessity not included in the certainty of the event, and to
disprove liberty in a sense in which it does not interfere with that
certainty, or with philosophical necessity: that is, I shall attempt to
show in what sense, in conformity with the general law to which all
things are by their nature subject, man is an agent, a free agent, a
moral and accountable agent; that is, deserving of reward and punishment,
praise and blame, &#38;c. Now by an agent I mean any thing
that acts or has a power to operate, that is, to produce effects; by a
free agent I mean one that is not hindered from acting; by a moral
and accountable agent I mean one that acts from will, and is influenced
by motives; by reward and punishment I mean what every
one does; by praise and blame I mean our approbation or disapprobation
of any agent that is conscious of our sentiments towards him,
or that is capable of reflecting on his own conduct, and of being
affected by what others think of it. If by an agent be meant the
beginner of action, or one that produces an effect of itself, there can
be no such thing; but if by an agent be meant one that contributes to
an effect, there is such a thing as an agent; and the more any thing
contributes to an effect and determines it to be this or that, the more
it is an agent. If by freedom be meant a freedom from causes, or
necessity in the abstract, there can be no freedom in this sense, but
there may be and is a freedom from certain causes and from certain
kinds and degrees of necessity; that is, from physical causes, or compulsion,
and from absolute, unconditional necessity. If all things are
equally necessary, that do not spring out of nothing, then indeed the
distinction between liberty and necessity must be in all cases absurd.
Again, by free-will I do not mean the power or liberty to act without
motives, but with motives. The mind cannot act without an occasion
or ground for acting, but this does not shew that it is no agent at all,
or that it is not a free agent; that is, that its action is restrained or
hindered by the action of anything else. The intellectual and voluntary
powers are free, just as the corporeal are, namely, when they are
free to produce certain effects, which, if excited, they can produce, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the body is free when it can move in consequence of the mind’s
direction; it is no longer free when though the same reason exists for
its moving, it is hindered by something else from obeying the impulse.
In short, liberty is this: the power in any agent in given circumstances
to operate in a certain manner, if left to itself; or perhaps more unequivocally,
opportunity given to any agent to exert certain powers to
produce an effect, when nothing but those powers and the absence of
impediments is wanting to produce it. To be free is to possess all
the requisites for acting in one’s-self, and in the circumstances, and
not to be counteracted. Again if moral good and evil are supposed to
be something self-created, then they are merely fictions of the mind;
but if we suppose an agent to be entitled to praise or blame, reward or
punishment, not because he is a self-willed, but a voluntary agent, that
is to say, a being possessing certain powers and habitually and with
determination exerting them to certain purposes, then there will be a
foundation for this distinction in nature. To the idea of moral responsibility,
it is not necessary that the agent should be the sole or absolutely
first cause of the evil, for example, but that he should be one
real, determining cause of it, and while he remains what he is, the
same effects will follow. An agent is the author of any evil, when
without him, that is, without something peculiar and essential to his
disposition and character, it would not exist.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Every thing is an agent that is any way necessary or conducing
to an effect. The doctrine of second causes does not destroy agency.
It no more proves that those causes do not act because something has
acted before them, than that they do not exist, because something has
existed before them. The theological writers on this side of the
question affirm, I think improperly, that God or the first cause is the
sole agent in the universe, to which all second causes are to be referred
as instruments, having no real efficacy of their own. If so, all
events are produced immediately by the divine agency, that is, all
second causes are parts of the divine essence, and in all that we see
or hear or feel, we must conceive of something far more deeply interfused,
a spirit and a motion that impels all thinking things, all objects
of all thought, and breathes through all things. This doctrine is that
of Spinoza: but upon this supposition second causes, as the immediate
operation of the Deity are and must be real and efficient. On the
other hand, if to exclude this system of pantheism, we consider the
things and appearances about us as merely natural, still what are called
second causes must be real and efficient causes, or they could not
produce their effects. If nothing can operate but the first cause, then
whatever produces effects is the Deity: but if this conclusion be
thought objectionable, then we must allow other causes of events to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>really and truly such in themselves: for from that which is no cause,
which has no power, any more than nothing, nothing can follow. All
second causes, that is, all things that exist are, therefore, either parts
of the Deity or parts of nature, and in neither case can they be
absolutely insignificant, worthless, null, and of no account. Dr.
Priestley is for having men refer all the good in the universe to God
as the author of it, and all the evil that takes place to man or to
second causes. I cannot think that this is sound philosophy nor
practical wisdom. The necessarians have evidently borrowed their
notions of agency and second causes from the advocates for liberty:
for taking up the same unfounded assumption of the libertarians, that
action is the absolute beginning of motion, and that any thing short of
this is no action at all, and finding that the will was not a cause in the
absurd sense supposed by their adversaries, they have concluded that
it was no cause at all; not considering whether a cause might not be
more properly defined that which produces an effect in consistency
with other things than that which produces it independently of them.
Action then in any sense of the word is the same as co-operation.
It may be asked, whether this account does not destroy the distinction
between active and passive. I answer that it does, if by active be
meant unconnected action, and by passive connected action; but not
else. That is, if by action be understood the positive determinate
tendency or the additional impulse to the production of any effect,
and by passiveness an indifference in any agent to this or that motion,
except as it is acted upon by, and transmits the efficacy of other
causes, this distinction will remain as broad and palpable as ever. Any
thing is so far active as it modifies and re-acts upon the original impulse;
it is passive in as far as it neither adds to, nor takes from that
original impulse, but merely has a power of receiving and continuing it.
This I take to be the practical and philosophical meaning of the
terms. This distinction therefore, applies equally to matter and
mind. The explosion of gunpowder cannot be attributed entirely or
principally to the spark which ignites it, because the effect is
increased a thousand-fold by the inherent qualities of the gunpowder.
The motion communicated by one body to another in void space is
considered as the mere passive result of the former, because the effect
in the second agent is simply the continuation of what it was in the
first. So it is in the mind. Motives do not act upon it simply or absolutely;
but according to the dictates of the understanding or the bias
of the will. At one time we yield to any idle inclination that happens
to prevail, and at others resist to the utmost the strongest motives.
That is, the mind is itself an agent, one chief determining cause of our
volitions. It is on the view taken by the mind of motives, on our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>disposition to attend to or neglect them, to compare and weigh them,
that their effect depends. But the necessarians have always delighted
to illustrate the operations of the mind in volition by referring to the
impulse communicated by one billiard-ball to another, or to different
weights in a pair of scales. Both which illustrations are as little applicable
as possible, because in neither of them is there supposed to be
the least activity of action; that is, the least capacity to resist or
increase or alter the impressed force in the thing acted upon. That is,
the mind in these similes is requisite as a merely passive agent, by
which I mean a thing perfectly indifferent and nugatory, a mere cypher
without any character of its own, that is neither good nor bad,
neither deserving of praise nor blame; a cameleon, colourless kind of
thing, the sport of external impulses and accidental circumstances, or
of a necessity in which it has itself no share. Thus the responsibility
of the mind has been taken from it, and transferred to outward circumstances,
and all characters in themselves rendered alike indifferent.
This is the necessary consequence of abstracting the influence of
motives from the mind on which and by which they act. I prefer
exceedingly to the modern instances of a couple of billiard-balls, or a
pair of scales, the illustration of Chrysophus, the stoic in Cicero, who
says, ‘<span lang="la">Ille igitur qui protrusit cylindrum dedit ei principium motionis,
volubilitatem autem non dedit: sic visum objectum imprimet quidem
et quasi signabit in animo suam speciem, sed assensio erit in potestate
nostrâ.</span>’ That is, suppose I push against a heavy body; if it be
square it will not move: if it be cylindrical it will. What the difference
of form is to the stone, the difference of disposition is to the
mind. In fact, the necessarians, to maintain this doctrine of the
nullity of second causes, have been forced to consider every thing as a
succession of simple impulses passing from hand to hand: so that
there being no fixed point, no resting-place for the imagination, we
are perpetually obliged to shift the cause from one object to another:
every thing has to be accounted for, and referred back to something
else, and in this ceaseless whirl of fleeting causes all ideas of power
or agency seem to slide from under us. Lest the mind should prove
refractory, to the laws ascribed to it, they thought it most prudent to
deprive it of all activity and power of resistance. They were very
absurdly afraid that without this their whole scheme might be overturned,
as if though the mind were freed from being the servile drudge
of external impulses, it would not still follow the bent of its own
nature. The above distinction will, I conceive, set the mind free
from one of the shackles imposed on it by the necessarians, namely,
that imbecility, helplessness, and indifference, which they have superadded
to the regular connexion of cause and effect, though it makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>no essential part of it. The mind, according to the advocates for free-will,
is a perfectly detached, unconnected, independent cause: according
to the necessarians, it is no cause at all: neither branch of the
antithesis is true.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. According to the definition of liberty above given, freedom,
that is free agency, is applicable to mind as well as to matter. Free-will
does not, because will does not, belong to it. By a free agent, I
understand, with Hobbes, one that is not hindered from acting according
to his natural or determinate bias. The body is free when it can
obey the impulse of the mind; so also a billiard-ball might be said to
be free while it is not fixed to the table, or hindered from being impelled
by the stroke of the mace. In the same sense, the water, as
Mr. Hobbes observes, is said to descend freely along the channel of
the river, while no obstacle intercepts its progress. But though necessarians
allow liberty to the body, and to inanimate things, they deny
that it is in any sense applicable to the mind or will.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON LOCKE’S ESSAY ON THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This work owes its present rank among philosophical productions, to
its embodiment of the great principle first brought forward by Hobbes.
All its author’s attempts to modify this principle or reconcile it to
common notions have been gradually exploded, and have given place
to the more severe and logical deductions of Hobbes from the same
general principle. Mr. Locke took the faculties of the mind as he
found them in himself and others, and endeavoured to account for
them on <em>a new principle</em>. By this compromise with candour and
common sense, he prepared the way for the introduction of the
principle, which being once established, very soon overturned all the
trite opinions and vulgar prejudices which were improperly associated
with it. There was in fact no place for them in the new system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great defect with which the ‘Essay on the Human Understanding’
is chargeable is, that there is not really a word about the
nature of the understanding in it, nor any attempt to show what it is
or whether it is or is not any thing, distinct from the faculty of simple
perception. The operations of thinking, comparing, discerning,
reasoning, willing, and the like, which Mr. Locke ascribes to it, are
the operations of nothing, or of I know not what. All the force of
his mind seems to have been so bent on exploding innate ideas, and
tracing our thoughts to their external source, that he either forgot or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>had not leisure to examine what the internal principle of all thought
is. He took for his basis a bad simile—that the mind is like a blank
sheet of paper, originally void of all characters whatever; for this,
though true as far as relates to innate ideas, that is, to any impressions
actually existing in it, is not true of the mind itself, which is not like
a sheet of paper, the passive receiver and retainer of the impressions
made upon it. The inference from this simile has however been that
the understanding is nothing in itself, nor the cause of any thing;
never acting, but always acted upon; that it is but a convenient
repository for the straggling images of things, a sort of empty room
into which ideas are conveyed from without through the doors of the
senses, as you would carry goods into an unfurnished lodging; and
hence it has been found necessary by succeeding writers to get rid of
those different faculties and operations which Mr. Locke elsewhere
allows to belong to the mind, but which are in truth only compatible
with the active powers and independent nature of the understanding.
I will first state Mr. Locke’s account of the origin of our ideas in his
own words, and will then endeavour to show in what that account is
defective; that is, what other act or faculty of the mind I conceive to
be necessary to the formation of our ideas, besides sensation or simple
perception. After employing eighty pages in a very laborious, and
for the most part sensible refutation of the doctrine of innate ideas,
which was popular at the time, but which Hobbes has not deigned to
notice, their impossibility being implied in the general principle that
all our ideas are derived from the senses, Mr. Locke proceeds in the
second book to treat of Ideas, and their origin. He then says:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Every man being conscious to himself that he thinks, and that
which his mind is applied about whilst thinking being the ideas that
are there, it is past doubt that men have in their minds several ideas,
such are those expressed by the words, <em>whiteness</em>, <em>hardness</em>, <em>sweetness</em>,
<em>thinking</em>, <em>motion</em>, <em>man</em>, <em>elephant</em>, <em>army</em>, <em>drunkenness</em>, and others: it is in
the first place then to be inquired how he comes by them. I know
it is a received doctrine that men have native ideas and original
characters stamped upon their minds in their very first being. This
opinion I have at large examined already: but I suppose what I
have said will be much more easily admitted when I have shewn
whence the understanding may get all the ideas it has, and by
what ways and degrees they may come into the mind, for which
I shall appeal to every one’s own observation and experience. Let us
then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all
characters, without any ideas: how comes it to be furnished?
Whence comes it by that vast store, which the busy and boundless
fancy of man has painted on it, in an almost endless variety?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I
answer, in one word, from <span class='fss'>EXPERIENCE</span>: in that all our knowledge is
founded, and from that it ultimately derives itself....</p>

<p class='c007'>‘First, our senses, conversant about particular sensible objects, do
convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according
to those various ways, wherein those objects do affect them; and thus
we come by those ideas we have of <em>yellow</em>, <em>white</em>, <em>heat</em>, <em>cold</em>, <em>soft</em>, <em>hard</em>,
<em>bitter</em>, <em>sweet</em>, and all those which we call sensible qualities, which when
I say the senses convey into the mind, I mean, they from external
objects convey into the mind what produces there those perceptions.
This great source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon
our senses, and derived by them to the understanding, I call <span class='fss'>SENSATION</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Secondly, the other fountain from whence experience furnisheth
the understanding with ideas, is the perception of the operations of our
own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got:
which operations when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do
furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not
be had from things without: and such are <em>perception</em>, <em>thinking</em>, <em>doubting</em>,
<em>believing</em>, <em>reasoning</em>, <em>knowing</em>, <em>willing</em>, and all the different actings of
our own minds; which we being conscious of, and observing in ourselves,
do from these receive into our understandings as distinct ideas
as we do from bodies affecting our senses. This source of ideas
every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as
having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and
might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I call the
other sensation, so I call this <span class='fss'>REFLECTION</span>; the ideas it affords being
such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within
itself.... These two I say, <em>viz.</em> external, material things, as the
objects of sensation, and the operations of our own minds within as
the objects of <span class='fss'>REFLECTION</span>, are to me the only originals from whence all
our ideas take their beginnings. The term <em>operations</em> here I use in a
large sense, as comprehending not barely the actions of the mind about
its ideas, but some sort of passions arising sometimes from them, such
as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The understanding,’ proceeds Mr. Locke, ‘seems to me not to
have the least glimmering of any ideas, which it doth not receive from
one of these two. External objects furnish the mind with the ideas of
sensible qualities, which are all those different perceptions they produce
in us; and the mind furnishes the understanding with ideas of its own
operations. These, when we have taken a full survey of them, and
their several modes, combinations, and relations, we shall find to contain
all our whole stock of ideas: and that we have nothing in our minds,
which did not come in one of these two ways.’—<cite>Essay</cite>, vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 84.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Again, page 150, he says:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I pretend not to teach but to inquire, and therefore cannot but
confess here again, that external and internal sensation are the only
passages that I can find of knowledge to the understanding. These
alone, as far as I can discover, are the windows by which light is let
into this dark room. For methinks the understanding is not much
unlike a closet, wholly shut from light, with only some little opening
left, to let in external visible resemblances, or ideas of things without:
would the pictures coming into such a dark room but stay there, and
lie so orderly as to be found upon occasion, it would very much
resemble the understanding of a man in reference to all objects of
sight, and the ideas of them.’</p>

<p class='c007'>This account of the origin of every thing that exists in the mind
differs from the simplicity of Hobbes’s system, and of the modern
philosophy, in supposing that there is another distinct source of ideas,
besides sensation, namely, reflection on the operations of our own
minds. I confess this addition appears to me to be very awkwardly
and inartificially made. For, in the first place, it is obvious to
remark that in most at least, if not all the instances enumerated by
the author, the operations themselves are the proper and immediate
sources of our ideas, not this kind of reflection on them, which seems
to be nothing but the repetition or recollection of the first conscious
impression, the perception of a perception. For example, Mr. Locke
includes among operations of our own minds ‘some sort of passions
arising from our ideas,’ <em>i.e.</em> as he explains it, the sense of pleasure
and pain. Now it is surely a little preposterous to make, not the
original feeling itself, but the after consideration or reflection on that
feeling, the source of our idea of pleasure or pain. In this sense,
reflection must be the source of all our ideas, whether of external
objects, or the operations of our own minds, for in the same sense
it may be argued, that the first impression of a sensible object is not
the source of the idea we have of it, till the soul comes to reflect on
and consider that original impression. But it might be said with
equal propriety, that we have one source of ideas, viz., sensation, and
another source of ideas, viz. ideas. From the view which Mr. Locke
has here taken of the subject, though the passions, or the satisfaction
and uneasiness attending certain things are ranked among the operations
of the mind, yet it is not quite clear whether we are supposed
to have any consciousness of them or not; whether they are not as
remote from any thing like perception, as the lifeless objects without
us, till coming to be afterwards reflected on and taken notice of by
the mind, they furnish the understanding with a new set of ideas.
The same reasoning may be applied to the other operations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>perception, thinking, &#38;c. for it seems to me that the original act of
perceiving or thinking is the source of my idea of those mental
operations, just as the first impression of any sensible object is the
source of my idea of that object. Not sensation and reflection,
therefore, but sensation and the operations of our own minds are more
properly the sources of our ideas, that is, these two furnish materials
for our reflection. I should not have dwelt so long upon this
distinction, which may be thought of little importance in itself, but
that I believe it has led to most of the errors of the ‘Essay.’ For
in consequence of separating the operations of the mind in a manner
from the mind itself, and making them exist only as objects for its contemplation,
Mr. Locke has been satisfied with considering those operations
as acting upon the mind like external things, not as emanating
from it. Thus, by a general formula, all our ideas of every kind are
represented as communicated to the mind by something foreign to
it, instead of growing out of, and being a part of its own nature and
essence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, another objection to this division of our ideas into those
of sensation and reflection is, that it does not differ in any decisive
manner from the more simple statement of Hobbes and others, who
derive all our ideas from sensation. For by sensation these writers
do not understand merely the external image, but the perception or
feeling which accompanies it, and they contend that all our other
ideas are continuations, modifications, or different arrangements of
the original impressions, produced by objects on the senses. Now
there is nothing in the extract above given to disprove this statement:
and if so, the original hypothesis will remain in its full force. Indeed
Mr. Locke himself does not seem to have made up his mind, whether
it were so or not. For though he speaks of the mind as furnishing
the understanding with ideas, and with the materials of reason and
knowledge, and enumerates and explains the several operations of
the mind in comparing, distinguishing, &#38;c. yet he elsewhere speaks
of ideas as existing in the understanding like pictures in a gallery, or
as if the whole process of the intellect were resolvable into the power
of receiving, retaining, carrying, and transposing the gross materials
furnished by the senses. In this case, I think the simplest way at
once is to make sensation the foundation of all our other ideas and
faculties. For my own part, the reason why I cannot assent to this
doctrine is, that I believe there is another act or faculty of the mind
implied in all our ideas, for which neither sensation nor any of its
modes can ever account, and which I shall here proceed to explain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle which I shall attempt to prove is, that ideas are the
offspring of the understanding, not of the senses. By a sensation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>meant the perception produced by the impression of the several parts
of an outward object, each by itself, on the correspondent parts of
an organised sentient being: by an idea I mean the conception produced
by a number of these together on the same conscious principle.
Besides the succession or juxtaposition of different sensible impressions,
I suppose that there is a common principle of thought, a
superintending faculty, which alone perceives the relations of things,
and enables us to comprehend their connexions, forms, and masses.
This faculty is properly the understanding, and it is by means of this
faculty that man indeed becomes a reasonable soul. What has led
more than any thing else to the exclusion of the understanding as a
distinct faculty of the mind, and to the principle of resolving the acts
of judging, reasoning, &#38;c., into mere association, or succession of
ideas, has been the considering ideas themselves, or those particular
objects which are marked by one name, or strike at once upon the
senses, as <em>simple things</em>. Mr. Locke, it is true, has avoided this error
as far as relates to our ideas of substances, but he reckons among
simple ideas of the qualities of things several ideas, which are
evidently complex, such as extension, figure, motion, and number.
Hence, having laid in a certain stock of ideas without the necessity of
the understanding, it was thought an easy matter to build up the
whole structure of the human mind without it, as we build a house
with stones. The method, therefore, which I shall take to establish
the point I have in view, will be by showing that there is no one of
these simple ideas, or ideas of particular things, which are made the
foundation of all the rest, that is not itself an aggregate of many things,
or that can subsist a moment but in the understanding. I can conceive
of a being endued with the power of sensation, or simple perception,
so as to receive the direct impressions of things, and also with
memory, so as to retain them for any length of time, as they were
severally and unconnectedly presented, yet without the smallest degree
of understanding, or without ever having so much as a single thought.
The state of such a being would be that of animal life, and something
more with the addition of memory, but it would not amount to
intellect; which implies, besides actual, living impressions, the power
of perceiving their relations to one another, of comparing and contrasting
them, and of regarding the different parts of any object as
making one whole. Without this ‘discourse of reason,’ this surrounding
and forming power, we could never have the idea of a single
object, as of a table or a chair, a blade of grass, or a grain of sand.
Every one of these includes a certain configuration, hardness, colour,
&#38;c., <em>i.e.</em> ideas of different things, received by different senses, which
must be put together by the understanding before they can be referred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to any particular thing, or considered as one idea. Without this
faculty, all our ideas would be necessarily decomposed, and crumbled
down into their original elements and fluxional parts. We could
assuredly never carry on a chain of reasoning on any subject, for the
very links of which this chain must consist would be ground to
powder. There would be an infinite divisibility in the impressions of
the mind, as well as in the objects of matter. There would be a
total want of union, fellowship, and mutual intelligence between them,
for each impression must remain absolutely simple and distinct, unknown
to, and unconscious of the rest, shut up in the narrow cell of its own
individuality. No two of these atomic impressions could ever club
together to form even a sensible point, much less should we be able
to arrive at any of the larger masses, or nominal descriptions of things.
The most that sensation could possibly do for us, would be to furnish
us with the ideas of what Mr. Locke calls the simple qualities of
objects, as of colour or pressure, though not as a general notion or
diffused feeling; for it is certain that no one idea could ever contain
more than the tinge of a single ray of light, or the puncture of a single
particle of matter. Let us, however, for a moment suppose that the
several parts of objects are to be considered as individual things, or
ideal units; and then see whether, without the cementing power of
the understanding, we shall be able to conceive of them as forming a
complete whole, or any one entire object. Thus we may have a notion
of the legs and arms of a chair as so many distinct, positive things;
but without the power of perceiving them together in their several
proportions and situations, we could not have the idea of a chair as
one thing, or as a piece of furniture, intended for a particular use. It
is the mind (if I may be allowed such an expression) that makes up
the idea of the chair, and fits it together: that is in this case the
cabinet-maker, who unites the loose, disjointed parts, and makes them
one firm and well-compacted object. I might instance to the same
purpose a statue. Will any one say, that if the head and limbs and
different parts of a fine statue were to be taken asunder, broken in
pieces, and strewed about the floor, and first shown to him in that
state, he would have the same idea of the beauty, proportions, posture,
and effect of the whole, as if he had seen it in its original state?
But the idea which such a person might have of the statue in this way
would be completeness and harmony itself, compared with any idea
which could result from the sensible impression of the several parts.
For he might still in fancy piece together the broken, mutilated
fragments, prop up the limbs, set the head upon the shoulders, and
make out a crazy image of the whole; but without the understanding
reacting on the senses, and informing the eye with judgment and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>knowledge, there would be no possibility whatever of comparing the
different impressions received: no one part could have the slightest
reference to any other part or to the whole; there would be no
principle of cohesion left: we might have an infinite number of
microscopic impressions and fractions of ideas, but there being nothing
to unite them together, the most perfect grace and symmetry would
be only one mass of unmeaning, unconscious confusion. All nature,
all objects, all parts of all objects would be equally ‘without form
and void.’ <em>The mind alone is formative</em>, to use the expression of a
great German writer; or it is that alone which by its pervading and
elastic energy unfolds and expands our ideas, that gives order and
consistency to them, that assigns to every part its proper place, and
fixes it there, and that frames the idea of the whole. Or, in other
words, it is the understanding alone that perceives relation, but every
object is made up of relation. In short, there is no object or idea
which does not consist of a number of parts arranged in a certain
manner, but of this arrangement the parts themselves cannot be
sensible. To make each part conscious of its relation to the rest is
to suppose an infinite number of intellects instead of one; and to say
that a knowledge or perception of each part separately, without
a reference to the rest, can produce a conception of the whole; that
is, that a knowledge where no two impressions are or ever can be
compared, can include a comparison between them and many others,
is a contradiction and an absurdity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be said perhaps, that not the sensation excited by any of
the parts of an object separately, but the sum of our sensations, excited
by all the parts, produces our idea of the whole. But it is not
possible that in a given number of impressions, where the mind never
has perception of more than a single part, there should be contained
notwithstanding a view of the whole at once. For as a single part
cannot of itself represent the whole object, so neither can this part by
being actually joined to others, which by the supposition are never
perceived to be joined with it, produce that idea, any more than if
those other parts had no existence. If the impression of the parts of
an object, absolutely and individually considered, were the same
thing as the idea of the object, any number of actual impressions,
arranged in any manner whatever, would necessarily be the same
object. But this is contrary to all fact. For then a curve line,
consisting of the same number of points, would not be distinguishable
from a straight one, nor a square from a triangle of the same
dimensions, and so on. In a being endued only with a power of
sensation, and supposed to be simple and undivided, there could be no
room for more than an individual impression at once. Our sensations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>must always succeed each other. One thought must have completely
passed away, before another could supply its place. Our ideas would
leave no traces of themselves, like the bubbles that rise and disappear
on the water, or the snow that melts as it falls. There would be
nothing in their fugitive, momentary existence to bind them together.
Ere we could stop to compare any one impression with any other, it
would be lost for ever in the dark abyss of time. Nothing could be
connected with any thing else, either coexisting with it, or going
before or after it. If on the other hand, we suppose any merely
sentient being to be extended and compounded, or to be capable of
receiving more than one impression at once, we shall yet gain little by
it. Such a sentient being will be nothing but a number of distinct
sentient beings. For as in the former instance, no two impressions
could co-exist together, so in the latter, though they existed together,
there could be no sort of communication between them. They would
be absolutely cut off from and exclusive of each other. The mind in
attending to any one must be wholly absorbed by it, and insensible of
the rest. Our sensations would to every rational purpose be placed
as completely out of the sphere of each other’s consciousness, as if
they were parcel of another intellect, or floated in the region of the
moon. That any number of detached, unconnected, actual sensations,
impressed on different sentient beings, would not of themselves imply
a conception of any one entire object is what every one is ready to
grant:—it would be equally clear, that this idea could not arise from
the impression of the different parts of an object on the different parts
of the same organized, extended, sentient substance, but that in this
case we involuntarily transfer our own consciousness to a being
incapable of it, and identify these distinct sensible impressions in the
same common intellect.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is strange that Mr. Locke should rank among simple ideas that
of number, which he defines to be the idea of unity repeated. But
how this idea of successive or distinct units can ever give the idea of
repetition unless the former instances are borne in mind, I cannot
conceive. There might be a transition from one unit to another, but
no addition or aggregate formed. As well might we suppose that a
body of an inch diameter by shifting from place to place might enlarge
its dimensions to a foot or a mile, as that a succession of units, perceived
separately, should produce the complex idea of number. The
natural fool that Mr. Hobbes speaks of, may be supposed to observe
every stroke of the clock, and nod to it, or say one, one, one: but he
could never know what hour it strikes, according to Mr. Hobbes,
without the use of those names of order, one, two, three, &#38;c. nor
according to my notion, without the help of that orderly understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>which first invented those names, and comprehends their
meaning. On the material hypothesis, the mind can have but one
idea at a time, and the idea of number could never enter into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though Mr. Locke constantly supposes the mind to perceive
relations, and explains its operations in reasoning, comparing, &#38;c. on
this principle, there is but one place in his work, in which he seems
to have been upon the point of discovering that this principle is at the
bottom of all our ideas whatever. He says, in the beginning of his
chapter on Power, which he classes among simple ideas, and which
in my opinion has a much more simple source than that which he
assigns to it,—‘I confess power includes in it <em>some kind of relation</em> (a
relation to action or change), as indeed which of our ideas, of what
kind soever, when attentively considered, does not? For our ideas
of extension, duration, and number, do they not all contain in them
a secret relation of the parts? Figure and motion have something
relative in them much more visibly: and sensible qualities, as colours
and smells, what are they but the powers of different bodies in relation
to our perception? and if considered in the things themselves, do
they not depend on the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of the parts?
All which include some kind of relation in them. Our idea therefore
of power I think may well have a place amongst other simple ideas,
and be considered as one of them, being one of those that make a
principal ingredient in our complex ideas of substances.’—<cite>Essay</cite>,
vol. i. p. 234. That is to say, in other words, the idea of power,
which is confessedly complex according to Mr. Locke, as depending
on the changes we observe produced in one thing by another, is to
pass for a simple idea, because it has as good a right to this denomination
as other complex ideas, which are usually classed as simple ones.
It is thus that the inquiring mind seems to be always hovering on the
brink of truth, but that timidity or indolence, or prejudice, which is
both combined, makes us shrink back, unwilling to trust ourselves to
the fathomless abyss.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have thus endeavoured to give some account of what I mean by
the understanding, as the principle which is the foundation not only
of judgment, reason, choice, and deliberate action, but is included in
every idea of the mind, or conception even of sensible objects. I am
aware that what I have said may be looked upon as rhapsody and
extravagance by the strictest sect of those who are called philosophers.
The understanding has been set aside as an awkward incumbrance,
since it was conceived practicable to carry on the whole business of
thought and reason by a succession of external images and sensible
points. The fine network of the mind itself, the cords that bind and
hold our scattered perceptions together, and form the means of communication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>between them, are dissolved and vanish before the clear
light of modern metaphysics, as the gossamer is dissipated by the sun.
The adepts in this system smile at the contradictions involved in the
supposition of perceiving the relations between different things, and
say that this implies the absurdity that the mind may have two ideas
at once, which is with them impossible. Now I shall only contend
that if the mind cannot have two ideas at the same time, it can never
have any, since all the ideas we know of consist of more than one:
and though the consciousness we have of attending to different objects
at once, when we compare, judge, reason, will, &#38;c., has been resolved
into a deception of the mind in mistaking a rapid succession of objects
for one general impression, yet it will hardly be pretended that we
deceive ourselves in thinking we have any ideas at all. Mr. Horne
Tooke, who is certainly one of the ablest commentators on the
doctrines of that school, says that it is as absurd to talk of a complex
idea as of a complex star, meaning that our ideas are as perfectly
distinct from, and have as little to do with one another, as the stars
that compose a constellation. Other writers, to avoid the seeming
contradiction of supposing the mind to divide its attention between
different objects, have suggested the instant of its passing from one to
the other as the true point of comparison between them; or that the
time when it had an idea of both together, was the time when it had
an idea of neither. As it was evident that while the mind was
entirely taken up with one idea, it could not have any knowledge of
another which did not yet exist, or had passed away, and as both
impressions cannot be supposed to co-exist in the same conscious
understanding (for on this system there is no such faculty), this
short, precious interval, this moment of leisure from both, this lucky
vacancy of thought, is pitched upon as that in which the mind performs
all its functions, and contemplates its various ideas in their
absence, as from some vantage ground the traveller stops to survey
the country on both sides of him. To such absurdities are ingenious
men driven by setting up argument against fact, and denying the most
obvious truths for which they cannot account, like the sophist who
denied the existence of motion, because he could not understand its
nature. It might be deemed a sufficient answer to those who build
systems and lay down formal propositions on the principle that the
mind can comprehend but one idea at a time, to say that they consequently
can have no meaning in what they write, since when they
begin a sentence they cannot have the least idea of what will be the
end of it, and by the time they get to the end of it must totally forget
the beginning. ‘Peace to all such!’</p>

<p class='c007'>To show, however, that I am not quite singular in my notions on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>this subject of consciousness, and to remove, as I think, every shadow
of doubt upon it, I beg leave to refer my readers to two passages, the
one in Rousseau, and the other in Abraham Tucker, in support of the
almost obsolete prejudice which I have here endeavoured to defend.
The one is an argument to prove that judgment and sensation are not
the same, in the Vicar’s profession of faith in ‘Emilius,’ and the
other is the chapter on the independent existence of mind in the
‘Light of Nature Pursued.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The passage in Rousseau seems evidently to have been intended as
an answer to the maxim of Helvetius that <em>to feel is to judge</em>, and to
his reasoning on this maxim, which is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The question being reduced within these limits, I shall examine
at present whether the act of the mind in judging is any thing more
than a sensation. When I judge of the size or colour of the objects
around me, it is evident that the judgment formed of the different
impressions, which these objects make upon my senses, is properly only
a sensation: that I may say indiscriminately, either I <em>judge</em>, or I <em>feel</em>,
that of two objects, the one which I call <em>a yard</em> makes upon me a
different impression from another which I call <em>a foot</em>: that the colour
called <em>red</em>, produces a different effect upon the sight from that which
I call <em>yellow</em>; and I conclude that in this case to judge is only to feel
or perceive by the senses. But it may be said, let us suppose that any
one desires to know whether strength of body is preferable to mere
bulk; are we certain that we can decide this point by means of the
senses alone? Most undoubtedly, I reply: for in order to my coming
to a decision on the subject, my memory must first retrace to me
successively the different situations in which I may happen most frequently
to find myself in the course of my life. In this case, then,
to judge is to see that in these different situations strength will be
oftener an advantage to me than size. But it may be retorted, when
the question is to decide whether in a king justice is preferable to
mercy, is it conceivable that the conclusion here formed depends
entirely on sensation? The affirmative has undoubtedly at first sight
the air of a paradox: nevertheless, in order to establish its truth, we
will presuppose in any one a knowledge of what is meant by good
and evil, and also of the principle that one action is worse than
another, according as it is more injurious to the well-being of society.
On this supposition, what method ought the orator or poet to take, in
order to show most clearly that justice, preferable in a king to mercy,
preserves the greatest number of citizens to the state?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The orator will present three several pictures to the imagination
of his supposed hearer: in the first he will represent a just king, who
condemns and gives orders for the execution of a criminal; in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>second, will be seen the good king, who opens the doors of his
dungeon, and strikes off the chains of the same criminal; in the third
picture, the criminal himself will be the principal figure, who, armed
with a poniard, on his escape from his cell hastens to assassinate fifty
of his fellow-citizens. But who is there that at the sight of these
three pictures will not instantly perceive that justice which, by the
death of a single individual, saves the lives of fifty persons, is preferable
to mercy? Nevertheless, this judgment is really nothing but a
sensation. In fact, if from the habit of connecting certain ideas with
certain words, the sound of these words may, as experience demonstrates,
excite in us almost the same sensations which we should feel
from the actual presence of the objects, it is evident that from the
contemplation of these three pictures, to judge that in a king justice
is preferable to mercy, is to feel and see that in the first picture a
single citizen is sacrificed, while in the third fifty are massacred;
whence I conclude that every act of the judgment is only a sensation.’—<cite>Helvetius
on the Mind</cite>, p. 12.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this statement I may be permitted to remark that as the author
affirms that sensation is the same thing as judgment, so he seems to
conceive that the assertion of any proposition is the same thing as the
proof of it. He supposes three several pictures to be presented to a
man of understanding, and that from an attentive contemplation and
comparison of the different objects and events contained in them, he
comes to a judgment or conclusion, <em>viz.</em> <em>That justice is preferable to
mercy</em>. ‘Nevertheless,’ he says, ‘this judgment is really nothing but
a sensation.’ This is all the proof he brings; and perhaps, considering
the language and country in which this celebrated author
wrote, it is reasoning good enough. Do I say this with any view to
throw contempt on that lively, ingenious, gay, social, and polished
people? No; but philosophy is not their <em>forte</em>: they are not in
earnest in these remote speculations. In order duly to appreciate their
writings, we must consider them not as the dictates of the understanding,
but as the effects of constitution. Otherwise we shall do
them great injustice. They pursue truth, like all other things, as far
as it is agreeable; they reason for their amusement; they engage in
abstruse questions to vary the topics of conversation. Whatever does
not answer this purpose is banished out of books and society as a
morose and cynical philosophy. To obtrude the dark and difficult
parts of a question, or to enter into an elaborate investigation of them,
is considered as a piece of ill-manners. Those writers, therefore,
have been the most popular among the French who have supplied
their readers with the greatest number of dazzling conclusions founded
on the most slight and superficial evidence, whose reasonings could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>applied to every thing, because they explained nothing, and who most
effectually kept out of sight every thing true or profound or interesting
in a question. Who would ever think of plunging into abstruse,
metaphysical inquiries concerning the nature of the understanding,
when he may with entire ease to himself and satisfaction to others
solve all the phenomena of the mind by repeating in three words,
<i><span lang="fr">Juger est sentir</span></i>. As it was the object of the school-philosophy, by a
jargon of technical distinctions, to sharpen the eagerness of debate and
give birth to endless verbal controversies, so the modern system, transferring
philosophy from the cloistered hall to the toilette and the
drawing-room, is calculated, by a set of portable phrases, as familiar
and as current as the forms of salutation, to silence every difference
of opinion, and to produce an euthanasia of all thought. I have made
these remarks not to prejudice the question, but to prevent the prejudice
arising on the other side, from seeing the writers of a whole
nation, not deficient in natural talents or in acquired advantages, agree in
delivering the most puerile absurdities as profound and oracular truths.</p>

<p class='c007'>The train of thought into which the author has fallen in the passage
above cited is pretty obvious. Having undertaken to prove that the
ideas of justice and mercy are mere sensations, and that the conclusion
that justice is preferable to mercy is also a mere sensation, in
order to shew the possibility of this he conjures up the ideas of a
good and a bad king, of a criminal, a prison, chains, a dagger, and
fifty citizens massacred before the eyes of the spectator, which form
the subject of three imaginary pictures, and which are in general considered
as so many sensible objects. All these sensible objects he
supposes to be implied in, and to be the materials out of which we
frame the judgment or conclusion, that justice is better than mercy;
and therefore he infers that there is nothing else implied in or necessary
to that judgment, and that consequently it is nothing but a
sensation. Having succeeded in resolving the compound and general
ideas of justice and mercy, good and evil, into a number of sensible
appearances, his imagination is entirely occupied with the novelty of
the objects before him, and he drops altogether the consideration,
whether the combination and comparison of these several objects or
sensations which is absolutely necessary to their forming the moral
ideas or inference spoken of, is not the act of some other faculty. In
short, the principle that a judgment is nothing but a sensation, is not
only a perfectly gratuitous assertion, but an assertion either without
meaning, or a palpable contradiction. For the single objects presented
in the foregoing metaphysical pictures, and which are supposed
to constitute the judgment, are not one sensation, but many. Now if
it be meant that these single objects, as they are perceived separately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>or successively, one by one, without the intervention of any reflex act
of the mind combining and comparing them together, constitute of
themselves the judgment, ‘that justice is preferable to mercy,’ this is
to say, in so many words, that the mind forms a comparison between
things without comparing them, and judges of their relations without
perceiving them. On the other hand, if it be meant to include the
acts of the mind in comparing, judging, inferring, &#38;c. in the term
<em>sensation</em>, then the proposition that judgment or sensation are the
same, will be nothing but an idle and insignificant abuse of words,
and will only prove that if to the sensation, or perception of particular
objects we add the faculty of comparing and judging, nothing farther
will be necessary for it to compare and judge. I shall therefore
dismiss this well known maxim as no better than a misnomer, as an
attempt to shorten the labour of thought by the interposition of an
unmeaning phrase, and to confound all the distinctions of the understanding
by an equivoque.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will not be amiss in this place to transcribe a passage from the
Logic of the Abbé Condillac (a work which may be regarded as the
quintessence of slender thought, and of the art of substituting words
for things) to show how far the doctrine of the origin of all our ideas
from sensation may be carried, and what an imbecility it produces in
the mind, and deadness to any but external objects. The design of
the passage is to prove that morality is a visible thing. This however
is a work of supererogation, even on the principle supposed: for
it is not necessary to refer morality to any thing visible or audible, or
to any other of the senses, but the sense of pleasure and pain; our
feelings of this kind being allowed to come from, and make a part of
our original sensations. But this system is not an improvement on
reason, but a progression in superficiality and absurdity, a vast vacuity,
where ‘fluttering its pennons vain, the mind drops down ten thousand
fathoms deep.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Moral ideas,’ says my author, ‘seem to elude the senses: they at
least elude the senses of those philosophers who deny that our knowledge
proceeds from sensation. They would gladly know of what colour virtue
is, or of what colour vice is. I answer that virtue consists in the habitual
performance of good actions, as vice consists in the habitual performance
of bad ones. Now these habits and these actions are visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘What, then, is the morality of actions a thing which falls under
the cognizance of the senses! Wherefore should it not? Morality
depends solely on the conformity between our actions and the laws;
but these actions are visible, and the laws are so equally, since they
are certain conventions made by men.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But it will be said, if the laws are only things of convention, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>must be altogether arbitrary. They may indeed be sometimes arbitrary;
there are but too many such laws; but those which determine
whether our actions are good or bad, are not so, nor can they be so.
They are the work of man, it is true, because they are conventions
which we have made; nevertheless, we alone have not made them:
nature made them as well as we, she dictated them to us, and it was
not in our power to make others. The wants and the faculties of
man being given, the laws which are to regulate his conduct must
necessarily follow: and though we enacted them, God who has
created us with such wants and such faculties, is in truth our sole
legislator. In obeying the laws which are conformable to our nature,
we render obedience to him who is the author of our nature; and
this is that which perfects the morality of actions.’—Page 56.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a work entitled Logic, there are a pleasant number of contradictions
in this passage. To pass over many of them, if the laws
here spoken of are such merely in consequence of their being visible,
then all visible objects are laws, and all laws are equally moral. But
no! there are some arbitrary laws. Now if the goodness of the law
depends on their conformity to our wants and faculties, neither of
these are visible, any more than God who is said to be our only lawgiver.
So that ‘the latter end of this system of law and divinity
forgets the beginning.’ That those actions are moral which are
conformable to a moral law, and that those laws are moral, which
are agreeable to our nature and wants, may be readily admitted: but
I cannot myself think that this conformity is an object of the senses,
or that the true features of morality can ever be discerned but by the
eye of the understanding. The friends of morality, it seems, according
to our author, are not to despair, or to suppose that the distinctions
of right and wrong are banished entirely out of the material system.
They only become more clear and legible than ever; we are still
right in asserting virtue to have a real existence, namely, on paper,
and in supposing that we have some idea of it, as consisting of the
letters of the alphabet. Almost in the same manner, Mr. Horne
Tooke very gravely defines the essence of <em>law</em> and <em>just</em>, from the
etymology of these words, to consist in their being something <em>laid
down</em>, and something <em>ordered</em> (<i><span lang="la">jussum</span></i>); and when pressed by the
difficulty that there are many things laid down and ordered which
are neither laws nor just, he makes answer that their obligation
depends on a higher species of law and justice, to wit, a law which
is no where laid down, and a justice which is no where ordered,
except indeed by the nature of things, on which the etymology of
these two words does not seem to throw any light.</p>

<p class='c007'>On all the other points of the modern metaphysical system, such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>as the nature of abstraction, judgment and reasoning, the materiality
of the soul, free-will, the association of ideas, &#38;c. Mr. Locke either
halts between two opinions, or else takes the common-place side of
the question. The motion of the system, which bears his name and
which by this very delay gained all that it wanted to become popular,
was retrograde in him, not progressive. The extracts I am about to
give from his work will I think establish this point. They will at
the same time show him to be a man of strong practical sense, of
much serious thought and inquiry, and considerable freedom of
opinion, and a real lover of truth, though not so bold and systematic
a reasoner, or so great a dealer in paradoxes as some others. Moderation,
caution, a wish to examine every side of a question, and an
unwillingness to decide till after the most mature and circumspect
investigation, and then only according to the clearness of the evidence,
seem to have been the characteristics of his mind, none of which
denote the daring innovator, or maker of a system. What there is
of system in his work is Hobbes’s, as I have already shown: the
deviations from its common sense and general observation are his own.
There is throughout his reasoning the same contempt for the schoolmen,
and the same preference of native, rustic reason to learned
authority: the same notion of the necessity for reforming the system
of philosophy, and of the possibility of doing this by a more exact
use of words: there is the same dissatisfaction with the prevailing
system, but he at the same time entertained doubts of his own. What
he wanted was confidence and decision. The prolixity and ambiguity
of his style seem to have arisen from this source: for he is
never weary of examining and re-examining the same objection, and
he states his arguments with so many limitations and with such a
variety of expression to prevent misapprehension, that it is often
difficult to guess at his real meaning. There is it must be confessed a
sort of heaviness about him, a want of clearness and connection, which
in spite of all his pains, and the real plodding strength of his mind he
was never able to overcome. To return to his account of complex
ideas: the beginning of his observations on this subject is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘We have hitherto considered those ideas, in the reception whereof
the mind is only passive, which are those simple ones received from
sensation and reflection before mentioned, whereof the mind cannot
make one to itself, nor have any idea which does not consist wholly
of them. But as the mind is wholly passive in the reception of all
its simple ideas, so it exerts several acts of its own, whereby out of
its simple ideas, as the materials and foundations of the rest, the other
are framed. The acts of the mind wherein it exerts its power over
its simple ideas, are chiefly these three.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>‘1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and
thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two
ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one
another, so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them
into one; in which way it gets all its ideas of <em>relations</em>. 3. The
third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in
their real existence; this is called <em>abstraction</em>: and thus all its general
ideas are made. This shows man’s power to be much about the
same in the material and intellectual world: for the materials in
both being such as he has no power over, either to make or destroy,
all that man can do is either to unite them together, or to set them
by one another, or wholly to separate them.’—Vol. i. p. 151.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first great point which Mr. Locke labours to prove in his
Essay, is that there are no innate ideas, which he seems to have
established very fully and clearly, if indeed so obvious a truth required
any formal demonstration. His chief proofs are from the case of a
man born blind, who has no idea of colours, and from the ignorance
which children and idiots have of those first principles and universal
maxims, which some philosophers and theologians, confounding the
faculties of the mind with actual impressions, had supposed to be
legibly engraven on the mind by the hand of its author. For the
supposing the understanding to be a distinct faculty of the mind no
more proves our ideas to be innate, than the allowing perception to
be a distinct original faculty of the mind, which everybody does,
proves that there must be innate sensations. These two positions
have, however, been sometimes considered as convertible by the
partisans on both sides of the question; the one arguing from the
existence of the soul and the power of thought to the positive perception
of certain truths, and the others concluding that by denying any
original inherent impressions, they had overturned the supposition of
the different faculties and powers which must be in the mind, to
account for the first production or subsequent modification of sensation
or of thought. For instance, it has been made a consequence
of the doctrine that there were no innate ideas, that there could be
no such thing as genius, or an original difference of capacity; as
if the capacity were not perfectly distinct from the actual impressions
by the very theory itself, and as if there might not be a difference in
the capacity of acquiring ideas as all experience shows, though none
in the knowledge acquired, because this capacity had never yet been
exerted. As well might we argue that of two houses that are just
built one is as commodious and capacious as the other, as well fitted
for the reception of guests and the disposal of furniture, because at
present neither of them is furnished or inhabited.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The following passages will show the manner in which our author
treats this part of his subject:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The child certainly knows that the nurse that feeds it is neither
the cat it plays with, nor the blackamoor it is afraid of: that the
wormseed or mustard it refuses is not the apple or sugar it cries for;
this it is certainly and undoubtedly assured of: but will any one say
it is by virtue of this principle, <em>That it is impossible for the same thing
to be and not to be</em>, that it so firmly assents to these and other parts
of its knowledge? Or that the child has any notion or apprehension
of that proposition at an age, wherein yet, it is plain, it knows a
great many other truths? He that will say, children join these several
abstract speculations with their sucking bottles and their rattles, may
perhaps with justice be thought to have more passion and zeal for his
opinion, but less sincerity and truth than one of that age. Though
therefore there be several general propositions that meet with constant
and ready assent as soon as proposed to men grown up, who have
attained the use of more general and abstract ideas, and names
standing for them, yet they not being to be found in those of tender
years, who nevertheless know other things, they cannot pretend to
universal assent of intelligent persons, and so by no means can be
supposed innate: it being impossible, that any truth which is innate
(if there were any such) should be unknown, at least to any one who
knows any thing else. Since if they are innate truths, they must be
innate thoughts; there being nothing a truth in the mind which it
has never thought on.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘That the general maxims we are discoursing of, are not known to
children, idiots, and a great part of mankind, we have already sufficiently
proved. But there is this farther argument against their
being innate, that these characters, if they were native and original
impressions, should appear fairest and clearest in those persons in
whom yet we find no footsteps of them. And it is in my opinion a
strong presumption that they are not innate, since they are least
known to those in whom if they were innate, they must need exert
themselves with most force and vigour. For children, idiots,
savages, and illiterate people being of all others the least corrupted
by custom or borrowed opinion, learning or education having not
cast their native thoughts into new moulds, nor by superinducing
foreign and studied doctrines, confounded those fair characters nature
had written there; one might reasonably imagine that in their minds
these innate notions should lie open fairly to every one’s view, as it is
certain the thoughts of children do. One would think according to
these men’s principles that all these native beams of light (were there
any such) should in those who have no reserves, no acts of concealment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>shine out in their full lustre, and leave us in no more doubt
of their being there than we are of their love of pleasure and abhorrence
of pain. But alas, amongst children, idiots, savages, and the
grossly illiterate, what general maxims are to be found? What universal
principle of knowledge? Their notions are few and narrow,
borrowed only from those objects they have had most to do with, and
which have made upon their senses the frequentest and strongest impressions.
A child knows his nurse and his cradle, and by degrees
the playthings of a little more advanced age; and a young savage has
perhaps his head filled with love and hunting, according to the fashion
of his tribe. But he that from a child untaught, or a wild inhabitant
of the woods will expect these abstract maxims and reputed principles
of science, will I fear find himself mistaken. Such kind of general
propositions [as that which is, is; and that it is impossible for the
same thing to be and not to be] are seldom mentioned in the huts of
Indians, much less are they to be found in the thoughts of children,
or any impressions of them on the minds of naturals. They are the
language and business of the schools and academies of learned nations,
accustomed to that sort of conversation or learning, where disputes are
frequent: these maxims being suited to artificial argumentation, and
useful for conviction, but not much conducing to the discovery of
truth, or advancement of knowledge.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not know that Mr. Locke has sufficiently distinguished
between two things which I cannot very well express otherwise than by
a turn of words, namely, an innate knowledge of principles, and innate
principles of knowledge. His arguments seem to me conclusive against
the one, but not against the other, for I think that there are certain
general principles or forms of thinking, something like the moulds in
which any thing is cast, according to which our ideas follow one
another in a certain order, though the knowledge, <em>i.e.</em>, perception of
what these principles are, and the forming them into distinct propositions
is the result of experience. It is true, the child distinguishes
between its nurse and the blackamoor, between bitter and sweet:
what hinders it from confounding them? The ideas of <em>same</em> and
<em>different</em> are not included in these ideas themselves, nor are they
peculiar to any of them, but general terms. What then determines
the child to annex them uniformly to certain things and not to others?
It is plain then, that our ideas are not at liberty to run into clusters as
they please or as it happens, but are regulated by certain laws, to
which they must conform; or that the manner in which we conceive
of things does not depend simply on the particular nature of the
things, but on the general nature of the understanding. Mr. Locke
is clear for certain innate practical principles or general tendencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>regulating all our actions, namely, the love of pleasure, and aversion to
pain. He does not however admit, as I can find, of any thing
similar to the operations of the understanding. The analogy, notwithstanding,
holds exactly the same in both cases. For the child is no
more conscious of any such general practical principle regulating all his
desires, than of any speculative principle regulating his notion of
things: he gets the idea of both from experience of their effects; but
I think that if there were no such principles in the mind itself, previous
to the actual impression of objects, and merely developed or
called into action by them, we must be perfectly indifferent both to the
reception of pleasure and pain, as we should feel no more repugnance
to admit one conclusion than another, however absurd or contradictory.
The necessity we are under of perceiving certain agreements or disagreements
between our ideas is as much, and in the same sense, the
foundation of judgment and reasoning, as the general desire of
happiness and aversion to misery is the foundation of morality.</p>

<p class='c007'>This property of the understanding, by which certain judgments,
naturally follow certain perceptions, and are followed by other judgments,
is the faculty of reason, of order and proportion in the mind, and
is indeed nothing but the understanding acting by rule or necessity.
The long controversy between Locke and Leibnitz with respect to
innate ideas turned upon the distinction here stated, innate ideas being
thus referred not to the actual impressions of objects, but to the forms
or moulds existing in the mind, and in which those impressions are
cast. Leibnitz contended that there was a germ or principle of truth,
a pre-established harmony between its innate faculties and its acquired
ideas, implied in the essence of the mind itself. According to the
one it was like a piece of free stone, which the mason hews with
equal ease in all directions, and into any shape, as circumstances
require: according to the other, it resembles a piece of marble strongly
ingrained, with the figure of a man, or other animal, inclosed in it,
and which the sculptor has only to separate from the surrounding
mass.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will add one more passage to draw the attention of my readers to
this intricate subject, and to show that the difficulties surrounding it
were not completely cleared up or even apprehended by the author of
the ‘Essay.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Hath a child,’ he says, ‘an idea of impossibility and identity,
before it has of white or black, sweet or sour? Or is it from the
knowledge of this principle that it concludes that wormwood rubbed
on the nipple hath not the same taste that it used to receive from
thence? Is it the actual knowledge of <i><span lang="fr">Impossibile est idem esse et non
esse</span></i> that makes a child distinguish between its mother and a stranger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>or that makes it fond of the one, and fly the other? Or does the
mind regulate itself and its assent by ideas that it never had? Or
the understanding draw conclusions from principles which it never
yet knew or understood? The names <em>impossibility</em> and <em>identity</em> stand
for two ideas, so far from being innate, or born with us, that I think
it requires great care and attention to form them right in our understandings.
They are so far from being brought into the world with us,
so remote from the thoughts of infancy and childhood, that I believe
upon examination it will be found that many grown men want them.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘If identity (to instance in that alone) be a native impression, and
consequently so clear and obvious to us that we must needs know it
even from our cradles; I would gladly be resolved by one of seven or
seventy years old, Whether a man, being a creature consisting of soul
and body, be the same man when his body is changed? Whether
Euphorbus and Pythagoras, having had the same soul, were the same
man, though they lived several ages asunder? Nay, whether the
cock too, which had the same soul, were not the same with both of
them? Whereby perhaps it will appear that our idea of sameness is
not so settled and clear as to deserve to be thought innate in us. For
if those innate ideas are not so clear and distinct as to be universally
known and naturally agreed on, they cannot be subjects of universal and
undoubted truths, but will be the unavoidable occasion of perpetual uncertainty.
For I suppose every one’s idea of identity will not be the
same that Pythagoras and thousand others of his followers have: and
which then shall be true, which innate? Or are these two different
ideas of identity both innate?’—Page 60.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two things are obvious to remark on this passage. First, it seems
clear that the child, before it can pronounce that one thing is or is not
the same as another, must have the idea of what <em>same</em> is, <em>i.e.</em> of identity:
or it would be impossible for it to know what is or is not the same.
This idea, then, is necessarily included in or the result of the first
comparison it is able to make between any two of its impressions as
alike or unlike. Secondly, the difficulty of determining the question
proposed by Mr. Locke does not arise from the meaning of the word
<em>identity</em>, but of the word <em>man</em>. For if this is once clear and settled,
there will be no great effort of the understanding required to determine
whether a man is the same or not. They define him to be a creature
consisting of body and soul, and it is plain that if one of these, the
body, is altered, the man is not the same. The whole question,
therefore, here seems to turn on deciding what qualities are essential
to the idea of man, so that by keeping or leaving out some, he will or
will not retain his identity, in the practical and moral sense of the
term. It is the complex and general idea of man that the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>wants, not that of identity or sameness which is reflected to it from
every object it meets, and which it perceives to agree or disagree
with some other.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a note to one of the chapters on Innate Ideas, there is some
account of the controversy between our author and the Bishop of
Worcester (Stillingfleet) on the question whether the idea of a God
be innate and universal. The Bishop is anxious to have the universal
belief in a Deity understood in a strict sense, while Mr. Locke thinks
it must be reduced to a very great and decided majority, there being
instances of whole nations without this idea. ‘This,’ he says ‘is all
the universal consent which truth of matter-of-fact will allow; and
therefore all that can be made use of to prove a God. I would crave
leave to ask your lordship, were there ever in the world any atheists
or no? For if any one deny a God, such a perfect universality of
consent is destroyed, and if nobody does deny a God, what need of
arguments to convince atheists?’—Page 63. This is the acutest turn
he has any where given to an argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>The concluding passage of his account of innate ideas is worth
quoting. It is a good description of the true spirit of philosophy, inclining
a little too much to self-opinion, from which, perhaps, it is not
easily separable:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘What censure doubting thus of innate principles may deserve from
men who will be apt to call it pulling up the old foundations of knowledge
and certainty, I cannot tell; I persuade myself at least that the
way I have pursued, being conformable to truth, lays those foundations
surer. This I am certain, I have not made it my business to quit
or follow any authority in the ensuing discourse; truth has been my
only aim; and wherever that has appeared to lead, my thoughts have
impartially followed without minding whether the footsteps of any
other lay that way or no. Not that I want a due respect to other
men’s opinions; but after all the greatest reverence is due to truth; and
I hope it will not be thought arrogance to say, that perhaps we should
make greater progress in the discovery of rational and contemplative
knowledge, if we sought it in the fountain, <em>in the consideration of things
themselves</em>, and made use rather of our own thoughts than other men’s
to find it. For I think we may as rationally hope to see with other
men’s eyes, as to know by other men’s understandings. So much as we
ourselves consider and comprehend of truth and reason, so much we
possess of real and true knowledge. The floating of other men’s
opinions in our brains makes us not one jot the more knowing, though
they happen to be true. What in them was science, is in us but
opiniatrety, whilst we give up our assent only to reverend names, and
do not, as they did, employ our own reason to understand those truths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>which gave them reputation. Aristotle was certainly a knowing
man; but nobody ever thought him so, because he blindly embraced
and confidently vented the opinions of another. And if the taking
up of another’s principles, without examining them, made not him a
philosopher, I suppose it will hardly make any body else so. In the
sciences, every one has so much as he really knows and comprehends:
what he believes only and takes upon trust, are but shreds, which
however well in the whole piece, make no considerable addition to his
stock who gathers them. Such borrowed wealth, like fairy money,
though it were gold in the hand from which he received it, will be
but leaves and dust when it comes to use.’—Page 80.</p>

<p class='c007'>In treating of the origin of our ideas, Mr. Locke labours to prove
that men think not always:—thinking, according to him, being to the
soul what motion is to the body; not its essence, but one of its
operations. In this opinion he may, as far as I know, be right: but
I think his proof of it drawn from the effects of sleep fails. The
reason why I think so is that I was never awakened suddenly but I
found myself dreaming, though in the interval required to awake
gradually from sleep we frequently forget our dreams before we are
quite awake, the impressions which objects have time to make upon
our bodies taking place of and obliterating the faint traces of our
sleeping thoughts. The common notion that the mind is then most
awake when the body is asleep, deserves the contempt with which Mr.
Locke treats it. It is one of the absurdities of <em>common sense</em>, which is
not entirely free from them any more than philosophy. Those who can
find any argument in favour of the immaterial nature and independent
powers of the soul in the sublime flights which it takes when emancipated
from the intrusion of sensible objects must have finer dreams than I have.
It would be well for this opinion if we could regularly forget the next
morning the smart repartees, magnificent sentiments and profound
remarks we so often dream we make. The singular significance which
in sleep we attach to absolute nonsense seems to arise from the very
impotence of our efforts, as we fancy that we can fly because we cannot
move at all. In sleep, indeed, the forms of imagination assume the appearance
of reality, but this advantage they seem to owe chiefly to what
Hobbes calls the silence of sense. That sleep, however, consists wholly
in this silence of sense (not affecting the mind itself) is so far from being
true, that it is not even necessary to it. Persons who walk in their
sleep, as I know from experience, get out of bed with their eyes open,
see and feel the objects about them, open the window, and leisurely
survey the opposite trees and houses, long before they recollect where
they are, or before the fresh air and the regular succession of known
objects dispel the drowsy phantoms of the night. The only essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>difference between our sleeping and waking thoughts I believe is, that
in sleep the comprehensive faculty flags and droops; so that being
unable to consider many things at once or to retain a succession of ideas
in mind, we confound things together, and pass from one object to
another without order or connexion, any single circumstance in which
they agree being sufficient to make us associate them together or substitute
one for the other. Our thoughts are, as it were, disentangled
from the circumstances and consequences which at other times clog
their motions: they are let loose, and left at liberty to wander in any
direction that chance presents. The greatest singularity observable
in dreams is the faculty of holding a dialogue with ourselves, as if we
were really and effectually two persons. We make a remark, and
then expect the answer, which we are to give ourselves, with the
same gravity of attention, and hear it with the same surprise as if it
were really spoken by another person. We are played upon by
puppets of our own moving. We are staggered in an argument by an
unforeseen objection, or alarmed at a sudden piece of information of
which we have no apprehension till it seems to proceed from the
mouth of some one with whom we fancy ourselves conversing. We
have in fact no idea of what the question will be that we put to ourselves,
till the moment of its birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke in treating of our sensations as effects of the impressions
of the qualities of things, distinguishes these qualities according to the
usual opinion into primary and secondary. The former he considers
as really and in themselves the same as they appear to our senses: the
other as merely the effects produced by certain objects on the mind
and not existing out of it. As this question forms one of the common-places
of metaphysical inquiry, I shall give some account of it in his
own words.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The qualities that are in bodies, rightly considered, are of three
sorts.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘First, The bulk, figure, number, situation, and motion or rest of
their solid parts; these are in them whether we perceive them or no;
and we have by these an idea of the thing as it is in itself: these I
call primary qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Secondly, The power that is in any body by reason of its insensible
primary qualities to operate after a peculiar manner on any of
our senses, and thereby produce in us the different ideas of several
colours, sounds, smells, tastes, &#38;c. These are usually called sensible
qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Thirdly, The power that is in any body, by reason of the particular
constitution of its primary qualities, to make such a change in
the bulk, figure, texture, and motion of another body, as to make it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>operate on our senses differently from what it did before. Thus the
sun has a power to make wax white, and fire to make lead fluid.
These are usually called powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The first of these, as has been said, I think, may be properly called,
real, original, or primary qualities, because they are in the things
themselves, whether they are perceived or no: and upon their different
modifications it is that the secondary qualities depend. The other
two are only powers to act differently upon other things, which powers
result from the different modifications of those primary qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But though these two latter sorts of qualities are powers barely,
and nothing but powers, relating to several other bodies, and resulting
from the different modifications of the original qualities, yet they are
generally thought otherwise of. For the second sort, viz., the
powers to produce several ideas in us by our senses, are looked upon
as real qualities in the things thus affecting us: but the third sort are
called and esteemed barely powers. For example, the ideas of heat
or light, which we receive by our eye or touch from the sun are commonly
thought real qualities, existing in the sun, and something more
than mere powers in it. But when we consider the sun in reference
to wax which it melts or blanches, we look on the whiteness and
softness produced in the wax, not as qualities in the sun, but effects
produced by <em>powers</em> in it: whereas, if rightly considered, these
qualities of light and warmth, which are perceptions in me when I am
warmed or enlightened by the sun, are no otherwise in the sun than
the changes made in the wax, when it is blanched or melted, are in
the sun. They are all of them equally powers in the sun, depending
on its primary qualities: whereby it is enabled in the one case so to
alter the bulk, figure, texture, or motion of some of the insensible
parts of my eyes or hands, as thereby to produce in me the idea of
light or heat; and in the other, it is able so to alter the bulk, figure,
texture, or motion of the insensible parts of the wax, as to make them
fit to produce in me the distinct ideas of white and fluid. The
reason why the one are ordinarily taken for real qualities, and the
other only for bare powers, seems to be, because the ideas we have of
distinct colours, sounds, &#38;c., containing nothing at all in them of bulk,
figure, or motion, we are not apt to think them the effects of those
primary qualities which appear not to our senses to operate in their
production, and with which they have not any apparent congruity or
conceivable connexion. Hence it is that we are so forward to
imagine that those ideas are the resemblances of something really
existing in the objects themselves. But in the other case, in the
operation of bodies, changing the qualities, one of another, we plainly
discover that the quality produced hath commonly no resemblance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>with any thing in the thing producing it; wherefore we look on it as
a bare effect of power. For though receiving the idea of heat or
light from the sun, we are apt to think it is a perception and resemblance
of such a quality <em>in</em> the sun, yet when we see wax or a fair
face receive change of colour from the sun, we cannot imagine that to
be the perception or resemblance of any thing in the sun, because we
find not those different colours in the sun itself. For our senses being
able to observe a likeness or unlikeness of sensible qualities in two
different external objects, we forwardly enough conclude the production
of any sensible quality in any subject to be an effect of bare
power, and not the communication of any quality, which was really in
the efficient, when we find no such sensible quality in the thing that
produced it. But ourselves not being able to discover any unlikeness
between the idea produced in us and the quality of the object producing
it, we are apt to imagine that our ideas are resemblances of some
thing in the objects, and not the effects of certain powers placed in the
modification of their primary qualities, with which primary qualities
the ideas produced in us have no resemblance.’ Vol. i. page 127.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the secondary qualities later writers, as Hume and Berkeley,
have proceeded to the primary ones, and have endeavoured to shew
that they have not a real existence out of the mind, any more than
the others. Hume says, ‘The fundamental principle of the modern
philosophy is the opinion concerning colours, sounds, tastes, smells,
heat and cold,’ &#38;c.; and Bishop Berkeley has made use of the same
principle to banish the least particle of matter out of the universe.
What Hume has said is merely taken from Berkeley, from whom
his opinions are generally borrowed. As I do not know that I shall
have a better opportunity, I will here state Berkeley’s arguments
against the existence of these primary qualities, or his <em>ideal</em> system, in
his own words. I will only first observe, on the argument against
the existence of the secondary qualities of things, from their different
effects in different circumstances and on different persons, which Hume
considers as the only solid one, but which Berkeley thinks more
doubtful, seems to me no argument at all; for that an object changes
its colour, or food its taste, is in consequence of distance or of the
interposition of another object, or of the indisposition of the organ, and
does not prove that the object has not a particular colour, or the food
a particular taste, but that colour is combined with and altered by the
colour of the air, and that taste is combined with and altered by another
taste in the mouth or stomach. The logical inference is merely that
one object has not the same sensible qualities as another, or, as Berkeley
has remarked, that we do not know what the true or natural qualities
of any object are.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>‘It is evident,’ says Bishop Berkeley, ‘to any one who takes a
survey of the objects of Human Knowledge, that they are either ideas
actually imprinted on the senses, or else such as are perceived by
attending to the passions and operations of the mind, or, lastly, ideas
formed by help of memory and imagination; either compounding,
dividing, or barely representing those originally perceived in the
aforesaid ways. By sight I have the ideas of light and colours, with
their several degrees and variations. By touch I perceive hard and
soft, heat and cold, motion and resistance, &#38;c. and of all these more
and less, either as to quantity or degree. Smelling furnishes me with
odours: the palate with tastes; and hearing conveys sounds to the
mind in all their variety of tone and composition. And as several of
these are observed to accompany each other, they come to be marked
by one name, and so to be reputed as one thing. Thus, for example,
a certain colour, taste, smell, figure, and consistence, having been
observed to go together, are accounted one distinct thing, signified by
the name <em>apple</em>. Other collections of ideas constitute a stone, a tree,
a book, and the like sensible things; which, as they are pleasing or
disagreeable, excite the passions of love, hatred, joy, grief, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘2. But besides all that endless variety of ideas or objects of
knowledge, there is likewise something which knows and perceives
them, and exercises divers operations, as willing, imagining, remembering,
&#38;c. about them. This perceiving, active being is what I call
<em>mind</em>, <em>spirit</em>, <em>soul</em>, or <em>myself</em>. By which words I do not denote any
one of my ideas, but a thing entirely distinct from them, wherein they
exist, or, which is the same thing, whereby they are perceived, for
the existence of an idea consists in being perceived.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘3. That neither our thoughts, nor passions, nor ideas formed by
the imagination, exist without the mind, is what every body will
allow; and to me it is no less evident that the various sensations or
ideas imprinted on the sense, however blended or combined together,
(that is, whatever objects they compose,) cannot exist otherwise than
in a mind perceiving them. I think an intuitive knowledge may be
obtained of this, by any one that shall attend to what is meant by the
term <em>exist</em>, when applied to sensible things. The table I write on, I
say, exists; <em>i.e.</em> I see and feel it, and if I were out of my study, I
should say it existed, meaning thereby, that if I was in my study
I might perceive it, or that some other spirit actually does perceive it.
There was an odour, <em>i.e.</em> it was smelt; there was a sound, <em>i.e.</em> it was
heard; a colour or figure, and it was perceived by sight or touch.
This is all that I can understand by these and the like expressions.
For as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things
without any relation to their being perceived, that is to me perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>unintelligible. Their <i><span lang="la">esse</span></i> is <i><span lang="la">percipi</span></i>, nor is it possible they should have
any existence, out of the minds or thinking things which perceive
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘4. It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing among men, that
houses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects, have
an existence natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the
understanding. But with how great an assurance and acquiescence
soever this principle may be entertained in the world, yet whoever
shall find in his heart to call it in question, may, if I mistake not,
perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction. For what are the
forementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense, and what,
I pray you, do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations? And
is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these, or any combination
of them, should exist unperceived?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘5. If we thoroughly examine this tenet, it will, perhaps, be found
at bottom to depend on the doctrine of <em>abstract ideas</em>. For can there
be a nicer strain of abstraction than to distinguish the existence of
sensible objects from their being perceived, so as to conceive them
existing unperceived? Light and colours, heat and cold, extension
and figures, in a word, the things we see and feel, what are they but
so many sensations, notions, ideas, or impressions on the sense; and
is it possible to separate, even in thought, any of these from perception?
For my part, I might as easily divide a thing from itself. I may,
indeed, divide in my thoughts, or conceive apart from each other,
those things which, perhaps, I never perceived by sense so divided.
Thus I imagine the trunk of a human body without the limbs, or conceive
the smell of a rose without thinking on the rose itself. So far
I will not deny I can abstract, if that may be properly called <em>abstraction</em>
which extends only to the conceiving separately such objects as
it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder. But
my conceiving or imagining power does not extend beyond the
possibility of real existence or perception. Hence, as it is impossible
for me to see or feel any thing without an actual sensation of that
thing, so it is impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any
sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it.
In truth, the object and the sensation are the same thing, and cannot
therefore be extracted from each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘6. Some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a
man need only open his eyes to see them. Such I take this important
one to be, viz. that all the choir of heaven, and furniture of the earth,
in a word, all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the
world, have not any subsistence without a mind, that their <em>esse</em> is to
be perceived or known; that consequently, so long as they are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>actually perceived by me, or do not exist in my mind or that of any
other created spirit, they must either have no existence at all, or else
subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit: it being perfectly unintelligible,
and involving all the absurdity of abstraction, to attribute to
any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit. To
make this appear with all the light and evidence of an axiom, it seems
sufficient if I can but awaken the reflection of the reader, that he may
take an impartial view of his own meaning, and turn his thoughts upon
the subject itself, free and disengaged from all embarrass of words and
prepossession in favour of received mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘7. From what has been said, it is evident there is not any other
substance than spirit, or that which perceives. But for the fuller
demonstration of this point, let it be considered, the sensible qualities
are colour, figure, motion, smell, taste, &#38;c.; <em>i.e.</em> the ideas perceived
by sense. Now, for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a
manifest contradiction; for to have an idea is all one as to perceive;
that, therefore, wherein colour, figure, &#38;c. exist must perceive them.
Hence it is clear there can be no unthinking substance or <em>substratum</em>
of those ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘8. But, say you, though the ideas themselves do not exist without
the mind, yet there may be things like them whereof they are copies
or resemblances, which things exist without the mind, in an unthinking
substance. I answer, an idea can be like nothing but an idea, a
colour or figure, can be like nothing but another colour or figure. If
we look but never so little into our thoughts, we shall find it impossible
for us to conceive a likeness except only between our ideas. Again,
I ask whether those supposed originals, or external things, of which our
ideas are the pictures or representations, be themselves perceivable or
no? If they are, then they are ideas, and we have gained our point;
but if you say they are not, I appeal to any one whether it be sense
to assert a colour is like something which is invisible: hard or soft,
like something which is intangible, and so of the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘9. Some there are who make a distinction between <em>primary</em> and
<em>secondary</em> qualities; by the former, they mean extension, figure,
motion, rest, solidity or impenetrability, and number; by the latter,
they denote all other sensible qualities, as colours, sounds, tastes, &#38;c.
The ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances
of any thing existing without the mind, or unperceived, but
they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be patterns or
images of things which exist without the mind, in an unthinking
substance, which they call <em>matter</em>. By matter, therefore, we are to
understand an inert, useless substance, in which extension, figure,
motion, &#38;c. do actually subsist. But it is evident from what we have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>already shewn, that extension, figure, and motion are only ideas
existing in the mind, and that consequently neither they nor their
archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance. Hence it is plain
that the very notion of what is called <em>matter</em> or <em>corporeal substance</em>
involves a contradiction in it, insomuch that I should not think it
necessary to spend more time in exposing its absurdity; but because
the tenet of the existence of matter seems to have taken so deep a
root in the minds of philosophers, and draws after it so many ill consequences,
I choose rather to be thought prolix and tedious, than
omit any thing that might conduce to the full discovery and extirpation
of that prejudice.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘10. They who assert that figure, motion, and the rest of the
primary or original qualities do exist without the mind, in unthinking
substances, do at the same time acknowledge that colours, sounds,
heat, cold, &#38;c. do not, which they tell us are sensations existing in
the mind alone, that depend on, and are occasioned by the different
size, texture, motion, &#38;c. of the minute particles of matter. This
they take for an undoubted truth, which they can demonstrate beyond
all exception. Now if it be certain that those original qualities are
inseparably united with the other sensible qualities, and not, even in
thought, capable of being abstracted from them, it plainly follows
that they exist only in the mind. But I desire any one to reflect and
try whether he can, by any abstraction of thought, conceive the
extension and motion of a body, without all other sensible qualities.
For my own part, I see evidently that it is not in my power to form
an idea of a body extended and moving, but I must withal give it
some colour or other sensible quality, which is acknowledged to exist
only in the mind. In short, extension, figure, and motion, abstracted
from all other qualities, are inconceivable. Where, therefore, the
other sensible qualities are, there must these be also, <em>i.e.</em> in the mind,
and no where else.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘11. Again, <em>great</em> and <em>small</em>, <em>swift</em> and <em>slow</em>, are allowed to exist
nowhere without the mind, being entirely relative, and changing as
the frame or position of the organs of sense varies. The extension,
therefore, which exists without the mind, is neither great nor small,
the motion neither swift nor slow; that is, they are nothing at all.
But, say you, they are extension in general and motion in general. Thus
we see how much the tenet of extended, moveable substances, existing
without the mind, depends on that strange doctrine of <em>abstract ideas</em>.
And here I cannot but remark, how nearly the vague and indeterminate
description of matter, or corporeal substance, which the modern philosophers
are run into by their own principles, resembles that antiquated
and so much ridiculed notion of <i><span lang="la">materia prima</span></i>, to be met with in Aristotle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and his followers. Without extension, solidity cannot be conceived;
since, therefore, it has been shown that extension exists not in an
unthinking substance, the same must also be true of solidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘12. That number is entirely the creature of the mind, even
though the other qualities be allowed to exist without it, will be
evident to whoever considers that the same thing bears a different
denomination of number, as the mind views it with different aspects.
Thus the same extension is one, or three, or thirty-six, according
as the mind considers it with reference to a yard, a foot, or an inch.
Number is so visibly relative, and dependent on men’s understandings,
that it is strange to think how any one should give it an absolute
existence without the mind. We say <em>one</em> book, <em>one</em> page, <em>one</em> line,
&#38;c., all these are equally units, though some contain several of the
others; and in each instance it is plain the unit relates to some
particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put together by the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘13. Unity, I know, some will have to be a simple or uncompounded
idea, accompanying all other ideas into the mind. That I
have any such idea answering the word <em>unity</em> I do not find, and if I
had, methinks I could not miss finding it; on the contrary, it should
be the most familiar to my understanding, since it is said to accompany
all other ideas, and to be perceived by all the ways of sensation
and reflection.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a> To say no more, it is an <em>abstract idea</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘14. I shall farther add, that after the same manner as modern
philosophers prove colours, tastes, &#38;c., to have no existence in
matter, or without the mind, the same thing may be likewise proved
of all other sensible qualities whatever. Thus for instance, it is
said, that heat and cold are affections only of the mind, and not
at all patterns of real beings existing in the corporeal substances
which excite them, for that the same body which appears cold to
one hand, seems warm to another. Now, why may we not as well
argue, that figure and extension are not patterns or resemblances of
qualities existing in matter, because to the same eye at different
stations, or eyes of a different texture at the same station, they
appear various, and cannot therefore be the images of any thing
settled and determinate without the mind? Again, ’tis proved that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>sweetness is not really in the sapid thing, because the thing remaining
unaltered, the sweetness is changed into bitter, as in case of a fever,
or otherwise vitiated palate. Is it not as reasonable to say, that
motion is not without the mind, since if the succession of ideas in the
mind become swifter, the motion, it is acknowledged, shall appear
slower without any external alteration.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘15. In short, let any one consider those arguments which are
thought manifestly to prove that colours, tastes, &#38;c. exist only
in the mind, and he will find they may with equal force be brought
to prove the same thing of extension, figure, and motion. Though
it must be confessed this method of arguing does not so much prove
that there is no extension, colour, &#38;c. in an outward object, as that
we do not know by sense which is the true extension or colour of
the object. But the foregoing arguments plainly show it to be
impossible that any colour or extension at all, or other sensible
quality whatsoever, should exist in an unthinking subject without the
mind, or in truth, that there should be any such thing as an outward
object.’—<cite>Principles of Human Knowledge</cite>, pp. 54, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, he says, page 58:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But though it were possible that solid, figured movable substances
may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of
bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this? Either we must
know it by sense or by reason. As for our senses, by them we have
the knowledge only of our sensations, ideas, or those things that are
immediately perceived by sense, call them what you will; but they
do not inform us that things exist without the mind, or unperceived,
like to those which are perceived. This the materialists themselves
acknowledge. It remains, therefore, that if we have any knowledge
at all of external things, it must be by reason, inferring their existence
from what is immediately perceived by sense. But I do not see
what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without
the mind, from what we perceive, since the very patrons of matter
themselves do not pretend there is any necessary connexion betwixt
them and our ideas. I say it is granted on all hands (and what
happens in dreams, frenzies, and the like, puts it beyond dispute)
that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have
now, though there were no bodies existing without resembling them.
Hence it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary
for the producing our ideas, since it is granted they are produced
sometimes, and might possibly be produced always, in the same
order we see them in at present, without their concurrence. But
though we might possibly have all our sensations without them, yet
perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of their production, by supposing external bodies in their likeness
rather than otherwise, and so it might be at least probable there are
such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds. But
neither can this be said, for though we give the materialists their
external bodies, they, by their own confession, are never the nearer
knowing how our ideas are produced, since they own themselves
unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit, or
how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the mind. Hence it
is evident the production of ideas or sensations in our minds, can be
no reason why we should suppose matter or corporeal substances,
since that is acknowledged to remain equally inexplicable with, or
without this supposition. If therefore it were possible for bodies to
exist without the mind, yet to hold they do so, must needs be a very
precarious opinion; since it is to suppose, without any reason at all,
that God has created innumerable beings that are entirely useless, and
serve to no manner of purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But say what we can, some one perhaps might be apt to reply,
he will still believe his senses, and never suffer any arguments, how
plausible soever, to prevail over the certainty of them. Be it so,
assert the evidence of sense as high as you please, we are willing to
do the same. That what I see and hear, and feel, doth exist, <em>i.e.</em> is
perceived by me, I no more doubt than I do of my own being: but
I do not see how the testimony of sense can be alleged as a proof
for the existence of any thing which is not perceived by sense. We
are not for having any man turn sceptic, and disbelieve his senses;
on the contrary, we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable,
nor are there any principles more opposite to scepticism than those
we have laid down, as shall be hereafter clearly shown. Secondly,
it will be objected that there is a great difference between real fire,
for instance, and the idea of fire, betwixt dreaming or imagining
oneself burnt and actually being so: if you suspect it to be only the
idea of fire which you see, do but put your hand into it, and you’ll
be convinced with a witness. This and the like may be urged in
opposition to our tenets. To all which the answer is evident from
what hath been already said, and I shall only add in this place,
that if real fire be very different from the idea of fire, so also is the
real pain that it occasions very different from the idea of the same
pain, and yet nobody will pretend that real pain either is, or can
possibly be, in an unperceiving thing or without the mind, any more
than its idea.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Now with regard to this system, whatever we may think of the
solidity of the foundation, the superstructure is as light and elegant as
possible. There is a peculiar character in the metaphysical writings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of Berkeley which is to be found no where else. With all the
closeness and subtilty of the deepest reflection, they combine the
ease and vivacity of a common essay: so that the most violent
paradoxes and elaborate distinctions are rendered familiar by the
simplicity of the style. His writings show that he had thought
with the utmost intensity on almost every subject, yet he has the
same careless freedom of manner as if he had never thought at all.
He is never entangled in the labyrinth of his own thoughts, and the
buoyancy of his spirit surmounts every objection with a singular
felicity, as if his mind had wings. It is perhaps worth remarking
that the ‘Principles of Human Knowledge’ were published in
1710, at a time when the author was only five-and-twenty, as was
the ‘Essay on Vision,’ the greatest by far of all his works, and the
most complete example of elaborate analytical reasoning and particular
induction joined together that perhaps ever existed. It is also generally
free from that air of paradox and fanciful hypothesis which runs
through his other writings.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a> I mention this the more because I
believe that the greatest efforts of intellect have almost always been
made while the passions are in their greatest vigour, and before hope
loses its hold on the heart, and is the elastic spring which animates
all our thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the reasoning I have just quoted I will make one or two
remarks without pretending to enter into the real difficulties of the
question. First, it seems to me that the argument against the existence
of the secondary qualities, drawn from the various effects produced
by them on different minds or in different circumstances, which
Hume mentions as the only solid one, and which Berkeley thinks
more doubtful, is no argument at all. That an object at a distance,
for example, does not look like the same object near is in consequence
of the interposition of the air, which gives it a different hue; the
logical inference merely is that one object has not the same sensible
qualities as another, or as Berkeley has remarked, since the effect
depends upon the combination and reaction of a number of things that
we do not know what the true or natural qualities of each object are.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The proof of the non-existence of the primary qualities or of
matter altogether, as inconceivable by the mind, goes upon the supposition
that what is different cannot be the same. ‘An idea,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Berkeley, ‘can be like nothing but an idea, a perception like nothing
but a perception.’ But it might be proved in this manner that a
print cannot resemble a picture, because that which has colour cannot
be represented by any thing without colour. That as far as our ideas
are perceptions they do not resemble any thing in matter is true, but
no one ever supposed that in this respect there was any resemblance
between them, or that matter thought. That they cannot be alike in
any thing does not seem to me proved by this mode of reasoning:
for that our ideas of things are not mere perceptions is evident from
this, that they are different among themselves, that is, have other
distinguishing qualities besides being perceived.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Berkeley’s argument against the existence of matter not merely
as the object or archetype, but as the cause of our sensations, is
founded on the notion that we have a right to reject every general
conclusion in which there is the least flaw or difficulty. Common
sense is brought to the bar, like an old offender, and condemned upon
the slightest shadow of evidence. If the vulgar system is vulnerable
in any part, it is taken for granted that it ought to be discarded, to
make room for a perfectly rational and philosophical account, the
sufficiency of the understanding being never once doubted. But all
this severe logic and scrutiny into the perfect connexion of our ideas
vanishes, when the author comes to explain the cause of our external
impressions, or to find a substitute for matter. This, he says, is God
or an all-powerful spirit, and yet he affirms that we have no more idea
of spirit than of matter, and consequently the one ought upon this
theory to pass for a nonentity as much as the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘We perceive a continual succession of ideas, some are anew
excited, others are changed or totally disappear. There is therefore
some cause of those ideas, whereon they depend, and which produces
and changes them. That this cause cannot be any quality or idea or
combination of ideas, is clear from what has been said. It must
therefore be a substance, but it has been shewn that there is no corporeal
or material substance. It remains therefore that the cause of
ideas is an incorporeal active substance or spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘A spirit is one simple, undivided, active being: as it perceives
ideas, it is called the understanding, and as it produces or otherwise
operates about them, it is called the will. Hence there can be no
idea formed of a soul or spirit. For all ideas whatever being passive
and inert, they cannot represent unto us by way of image or likeness
that which acts. Such is the nature of spirit or that which acts, that
it cannot be itself perceived, but only by the effects which it produceth.
If any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered,
let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>active being. A little attention will make it plain to any one, that to
have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and
change of ideas, is absolutely impossible.’ That is to say, matter is
here excluded from being the cause or in any way the occasion of our
ideas, because we know not what it is, and the inference is, that the
cause of our ideas must be spirit, of which we are equally ignorant.
The reasoning might have been reversed. But it is thus that philosophy
seems to be in general nothing else but ‘reason pandering
will.’ The literal conclusion from the foregoing argument is, that
there is nothing in the universe but oneself, nor even that, but only
the present idea: all other words must signify nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to Mr. Locke. He has treated on the same question
in the second volume, but without advancing any thing remarkable
on it, and it is the only place in which he loses his temper, and
substitutes ridicule for argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the chapter on Perception, there are some observations on the
manner in which our judgments alter the impressions of sensible
objects, which are well worth notice, and show that the author was
well acquainted with what may be called the practical processes of
the human mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>He says, p. 130, ‘We are farther to consider concerning perception,
that the ideas we receive by sensation are often in grown people
altered by the judgment without our taking notice of it. When we
set before our eyes a round globe of any uniform colour, <em>e.g.</em> gold,
alabaster, or jet, it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted in our
mind is of a flat circle, variously shadowed with several degrees of
light and brightness coming to our eyes. But we having by use been
accustomed to perceive what kind of appearance convex bodies are
wont to make in us, what alterations are made in the reflections of
light by the difference of the sensible figures of bodies, the judgment
presently, by an habitual custom, alters the appearances into their
causes; so that from that which truly is variety of shadow or colour,
collecting the figure, it makes it pass for a mark of figure, and frames
to itself the perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour,
when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously
coloured; as is evident in painting. To which purpose I shall here
insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of
real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molineux, which he
was pleased to send me in a letter some months since: and it is this:
“Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch
to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and
nigh of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt the one and the
other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see: Quere,
whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish
and tell which is the globe, which the cube?” To which the
acute and judicious proposer answers, “No. For though he has
obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch,
yet he has not yet attained the experience that what affects his touch
so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in
the cube that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it
does in the cube.” I agree’ (says Mr. Locke) ‘with this thinking
gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this
his problem; and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight,
would not be able with certainty to say, which was the globe, which
the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name
them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference
of their figures felt. This I have set down, and leave with my
reader as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be
beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where
he thinks he has not the least use of, or help from them, and the
rather, because this observing gentleman farther adds, that having
upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious
men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it
which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced.’
Mr. Locke then adds other instances to the same effect, as ‘That a
man who reads or hears with attention and understanding takes little
notice of the characters or sounds, but of the ideas that are excited in
him by them. How frequently do we in a day cover our eyes with
our eyelids, without at all perceiving that we are in the dark! Men
that by custom have got the use of a by-word do almost in every
sentence pronounce sounds, which though taken notice of by others,
they themselves neither hear nor observe: and therefore it is not so
strange that our mind should often change the idea of its sensation
into that of its judgment, and make one serve only to excite the other
without our taking notice of it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>On the problem above stated, which has been often made a subject
of dispute, I shall only remark that the answer given to it, with
which Mr. Locke agrees, is directly repugnant to his doctrine of the
real existence of the primary qualities of matter, namely figure and
extension. For it is plain, that if there is any thing in external
objects answering to their ideas in our minds, the ideas we have of
those qualities and which are conveyed by different senses, must be
like one another. If the ideas of figure as a visible and tangible
thing have no resemblance to themselves, it is ridiculous to suppose
that they can coincide with any thing out of them in nature. Secondly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>it appears to me that the mind must recognise a certain similarity
between the impressions of different senses in this case. For instance,
the sudden change or discontinuity of the sensation, produced by the
sharp angles of the cube, is something common to both ideas, and if
so, must afford a means of comparing them together. Berkeley, in his
‘Essay on Vision,’ goes so far as to deny that there is any intuitive
analogy between the ideas of number as conveyed by different senses,
and asserts that the distinction between the two legs of a statue, for
instance, as perceived by the touch or by the sight would not imply
any idea of like or same. I grant this consequence to be true, on the
principle maintained by him that there are no abstract ideas in the
mind, for on this principle there can be no idea answering to the
words <em>same</em> or <em>different</em>, but then this argument would destroy all kind
of coincidence not only between ideas of different senses, but between
repeated impressions of the same sense. The ‘Essay on Vision,’ of
which I have already spoken, apparently originated in the problem
here inserted, and is a more complete exemplification of the effects of
association with respect to objects of sight than is to be found even in
Hartley’s account of this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke’s account of the distinction between wit and understanding
I have already noticed; his explanation of the difference
between idiots and madmen has been often referred to, and is as
follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The defect in naturals seems to proceed from want of quickness,
activity, and motion in the intellectual faculties, whereby they are
deprived of reason: whereas madmen, on the other side, seem to
suffer by the other extreme. For they do not appear to me to have
lost the faculty of reasoning; but having joined together some ideas
very wrongly, they mistake them for truths; and they err as men do
that argue right from wrong principles: for, by the violence of their
imaginations, having taken their fancies for realities, they make right
deductions from them. Thus you shall find a distracted man, fancying
himself a king, with a right inference require suitable attendance,
respect, and obedience: others, who have thought themselves made
of glass, have used the caution necessary to preserve such brittle
bodies. Hence it comes to pass, that a man who is very sober, and
of a right understanding in all other things, may in one particular be
as frantic as any in Bedlam, if either by any sudden very strong
impression, or long fixing his fancy upon one sort of thoughts,
incoherent ideas have been cemented together so powerfully as to
remain united. But there are degrees of madness, as of folly; the
disorderly jumbling together of ideas is in some more, and some less.
In short, herein seems to lie the difference between idiots and madmen:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>that madmen put wrong ideas together, and so make wrong
propositions, but argue and reason right from them: but idiots make
very few or no propositions, and reason scarce at all.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke’s account of Liberty and Necessity, contained in his
chapter ‘On Power,’ has been commented upon in the previous Essay.
As is there remarked, it is one which has been more found fault with
than any other part of his work, I think without reason. He seems
evidently to have admitted the definition of necessity, but not the
name, which is not much to be wondered at, considering the improper
use to which it is liable, and which can scarce be separated from it in
the closest reasoning, much less as a term of general signification: in
other words, he denies the power of the mind to act without a cause
or motive, or, in any manner, in any circumstances, from mere
indifference and absolute self motion; but he at the same time denies
the inference which has been drawn from this principle, that the mind
is not an agent at all, but altogether subject to external force, or blind
impulse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke, in treating of complex ideas, divides them into three
sorts, those of modes, substances, and relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, ‘Modes,’ he says, ‘I call such complex ideas, which,
however compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting
by themselves, but are considered as dependences on, or affections of
substances: such are the ideas signified by the words <em>triangle</em>, <em>gratitude</em>,
<em>murder</em>, &#38;c. Of these modes there are two sorts. 1. There are
some which are only variations or different combinations of the same
simple idea, without the mixture of any other, as a <em>dozen</em> or <em>score</em>,
which are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units added
together, and these I call simple modes. 2. There are others, compounded
of simple ideas of several kinds put together, to make one
complex one; <em>e.g.</em> <em>beauty</em>, consisting of a certain composition of colour
and figure, causing delight in the beholder; <em>theft</em>, which being the
concealed change of the possession of any thing, without the consent
of the proprietor, contains, as is visible, a combination of several ideas
of several kinds, and these I call <em>mixed modes</em>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to modes, the author endeavours to shew, I think
improperly, that as they are put together arbitrarily by the mind,
according to circumstances, that they have no real existence in nature,
and that the ideas we form of them are always correct. Neither of
these consequences will be found to follow: <em>i.e.</em> the circumstances and
actions which constitute theft do actually exist without the mind and
are necessary to that idea, though it is arbitrary in me according to the
occasion or the purpose in view, to think of that collection of ideas or
another, which shall constitute robbery; that is, I may add or leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>out the circumstance of violence, as it happens; secondly, I may,
without being aware of it, add or leave out some circumstance
necessary to the combination of ideas spoken of, and thus confuse one
idea with another, and not merely miscal, as Mr. Locke supposes, but
misconceive the mode in question. We then merely miscal when
though we give a wrong name to a thing, the idea is kept perfectly
distinct and clear from other ideas, otherwise we confound both
names and things. But it will not be contended, that the ideas of
theft, robbery, and fraud, for instance, are always kept clear in every
one’s mind, so that he is at no loss ever to define them, or can
immediately in all cases refer any action to the class to which it
belongs. Every collection of ideas which the mind puts together is
undoubtedly that collection and no other; but in forming the ideas of
mixed modes, the mind does something more than this, or it supposes
one collection of ideas to be the same as another which it has had at
a former time, and gives a certain name to, and in this supposition it
often errs.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this subject, the author is a good deal puzzled with the question,
how it is possible for the mind ever to confound one idea with
another? It is indeed a puzzling question, but the answer which he
gives to it in resolving it into a mistake of words, is very unsatisfactory.
For there is no more reason why we should mistake one name or sign
of an idea for another, than why we should mistake the ideas themselves.
If every circumstance belonging to our ideas was necessarily
clear and self-evident to the mind, the sign affixed to it, which is one
of those circumstances, would be so too, and we find that in those
things with which we have a thorough acquaintance, we never confound
one name with another, or if we should, it does not disturb the
idea, and is of no consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the second sort of complex ideas Mr. Locke classes those
of substances. These, he says, are such combinations of simple
ideas as are taken to represent distinct, particular things, subsisting
by themselves, in which the supposed or confused idea of substance,
such as it is, is always the first or chief. Thus, if to substance be
joined the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour, with certain
degrees of weight, hardness, ductility and fusibility, we have the
idea of lead; and a combination of the ideas of a certain sort of
figure, with the power of motion, thought, and reasoning, joined to
substance, make the ordinary idea of a man. Now of substances
also there are two sorts of ideas; one of single substances, as they
exist separately, as of a man or a sheep; the other of several of
those put together, as an army of men or a flock of sheep: which
collective ideas of several substances are as much each of them one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>single idea as that of a man or an unit.’ He then adds, ‘and the
third sort of complex ideas is that which we call relative, which
consists in the consideration and comparing one idea with another.’
This last sort of ideas seems to me the only ones that are perfectly
simple and indivisible: things themselves are always complex.
Mr. Locke considers rightly that we know nothing of the nature
of substance, and that we can only define it as an abstract idea of
some thing, that supports accidents or connects different sensible
qualities together. For this modest confession of his own ignorance
he was however called to a very severe account by the learned of
the time, Bishop Stillingfleet and others, who thought they knew
more of the matter, and could penetrate the essence of things.
The ‘Essay on the Human Understanding’ is swelled out with
repeated and long extracts from this controversy, and they are not
the least valuable part of the work, as they show to what shifts
men can be driven, to defend systematically not truth but their own
opinion, who become blind and obstinate by implicit faith, and who
by adhering to every established prejudice drive others into all the
absurdities of paradox.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke’s own account of our ideas of substance is a good
deal spun out, and is enriched with as many illustrations from the
qualities of gold, as if he had been candidate for the place of assay-master
of the mint. The chapter ‘On Identity’ is perhaps the best
reasoned and the most full of thought and observation of any in the
Essay: though the author sets out with an observation which seems
to augur differently. For after explaining identity as it relates to
individuality, or implies that a thing is the same with itself, he says,
‘From what has been said it is easy to discover what is so much
inquired after, the <i><span lang="la">principium individuationis</span></i>: and that, it is plain, is
existence itself, which determines a being of any sort to a particular
time and place, incommunicable to two beings of the same kind.’
He then, very wisely quitting this principle which would certainly be
of no use to him, proceeds directly to account for the identity of
different things from a continuance, not of the same substance, but
of the same essence, or of the characteristic properties of any thing,
carried on in succession; as a river is the same while it flows
through the same channel, or an oak while it retains the same
organization, and a man while he retains the same life and continued
consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the chapter entitled ‘Of true and false Ideas,’ the author
supposes truth to depend on some mental or verbal proposition, and
does not, like Hobbes and the modern metaphysical writers, make
it consist entirely in a form of words. In the last chapter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>first volume he treats of the association of ideas. This chapter was
added after the first edition of the work, and he confesses, that the
subject was something new to him. He has treated it in that mixed
way of observation and reasoning, in which the peculiar force of his
mind lay. The account he has given of it does not form a system,
but the fragments of a system, something like the French memoirs
that are to serve for the materials of a history. He does not appear
to have laid down any general theorem on the subject, or to have
been aware of the possibility of applying this principle to account
in a plausible manner for the whole chain of our thoughts and
feelings, as Hobbes and Hartley have done. Sound, practical,
good sense, and a kind of discursive observation, neither grovelling
in vulgar common place, nor soaring into the regions of paradox, are
in fact the general characteristics of his mind, which has not been
understood by his admirers and commentators. A short passage
will suffice to show his manner of considering this doctrine of
association.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Many children,’ he says, ‘imputing the pain they endured at
school to their books they were corrected for, so join those ideas
together that a book becomes their aversion, and they are never
reconciled to the study and use of them all their lives after: and
thus reading becomes a torment to them, which otherwise possibly
they might have made the great pleasure of their lives. There are
rooms convenient enough that some men cannot study in, and fashions
of vessels, which though ever so clean and commodious they cannot
drink out of, and that by reason of some accidental ideas which are
annexed to them, and make them offensive: and who is there that
has not observed some man to flag at the appearance, or in the
company of some certain person, not otherwise superior to him, but
because having once on some occasion got the ascendant, the idea of
authority and distance goes along with that of the person? And he
that has been thus subjected is not able to separate them. Instances
of this kind are so plentiful every where, that if I add one more,
it is only for the pleasant oddness of it: it is of a young gentleman,
who having learned to dance, and that to great perfection, there
happened to stand an old trunk in the room where he learned: the
idea of this remarkable piece of household stuff had so mixed itself
with all the turns and steps of his dances, that though in that chamber
he could dance exceedingly well, yet it was only whilst that trunk
was there; nor could he perform well in any other place, unless that,
or some such other trunk had its due position in the room.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The following passage approaches the nearest to the statement of a
general principle:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>‘This strong combination of ideas, not allied by nature, the mind
makes in itself either voluntarily or by chance: and hence it comes
in different men to be very different, according to their different
inclinations, educations, interests, &#38;c. Custom settles habits of
thinking in the understanding, as well as of determining in the will,
and of motions in the body: all which seems to be but trains of
motion in the animal spirits, which once set agoing continue in the
same steps they have been used to, which by often treading are worn
into a smooth path, and the motion in it becomes easy, and as it
were natural. As far as we can comprehend thinking, thus ideas
seem to be produced in our minds; or if they are not, this may serve
to explain their following one another in an habitual train when once
they are put into that track, as well as it does to explain such
motions of the body. A musician used to any tune will find, that
let it but once begin in his head, the ideas of the several notes of it
will follow one another orderly in his understanding, without any
care or attention, as regularly as his finger moves orderly over the
keys of the organ to play out the tune he has begun, though his
inattentive thoughts be elsewhere a wandering. Whether the natural
cause of these ideas, as well as of that regular dancing of the fingers,
be the motion of his animal spirits, I will not determine, how probable
soever by this instance it appears to be so; but this may help us
a little to conceive of intellectual habits, and of the tying together
of ideas. That there are such associations of them made by custom
in the minds of most men, I think nobody will question, who has
well considered himself or others; and to this perhaps might be
justly attributed most of the sympathies and antipathies observable
in men, which work as strongly and produce as regular effects as
if they were natural, and are therefore called so, though they at first
had no other original but the accidental connexion of two ideas,
which either the strength of the first impression or future indulgence
so united, that they always afterwards kept company together in that
man’s mind, as if they were but one idea. I say, most of the
antipathies, I do not say all; for some of them are truly natural,
depend upon our original constitution, and are born with us; but a
great part of those which are counted natural, would have been
known to be from unheeded though perhaps early impressions, or
wanton fancies at first, which would have been acknowledged the
original of them, if they had been warily observed.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The former part of this passage, relating to the dancing of the
animal spirits, the Abbé Condillac in his ‘Logic’ has paraphrased
with a self-sufficiency, an assumption of originality, and a smoothness
of flippancy, peculiar almost to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>On the subject of materialism, Mr. Locke seems to have had two
opinions; the first, that as far as we can discern, the properties
of mind and matter are utterly distinct and irreconcileable; the
second, that God might for aught we know be able to superadd to
matter a faculty of thinking: either the one or the other of these
opinions must be without meaning. In speaking of the difficulties
attending both sides of this question, he has, however, offered one
of the best moral cautions against precipitancy of judgment and
impatience of inquiry to be found in any author. He says, (vol. ii.
p. 203:) ‘He that considers how hardly sensation is in our thoughts
reconcilable to extended matter, or existence to any thing that hath
no extension at all, will confess that he is very far from certainly
knowing what his soul is. It is a point which seems to me
to be put out of the reach of our knowledge: and he who will
give himself leave to consider freely, and look into the dark and
intricate part of each hypothesis, will scarce find his reason able to
determine him fixedly for or against the soul’s materiality. Since
on which side soever he views it, either as an unextended substance,
or a thinking extended matter, the difficulty to conceive either, will,
whilst either alone is in his thoughts, still drive him to the contrary
side. An unfair way which some men take with themselves; who
because of the unconceivableness of some thing they find in one,
throw themselves violently into the contrary hypothesis, though
altogether as unintelligible to an unbiassed understanding. This
serves not only to show the weakness and scantiness of our knowledge,
but the insignificant triumph of such sort of arguments, which drawn
from our own views may satisfy us that we can find no certainty on
one side of the question; but do not at all thereby help us to truth,
by running into the opposite opinion, which on examination will be
found clogged with equal difficulties.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke has not, I think, himself enough attended to this
admirable caution in his adoption of the common argument to demonstrate
the existence of God <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, towards which I conceive not
the slightest advances can be made in this method. For the axiom
that every thing must have a cause can never be made to infer the
existence of a first cause, that is, of something without a cause.
It is equally impossible for the human mind to conceive of the
beginning of existence, or to pass from nothing to something, either
by the help of an infinite series of finite existences, or by the infinite
duration of one simple, absolute existence. Those who wish to see
how far human ingenuity can push a complete confusion of ideas into
the verge of the strictest logical demonstration and self-evident truth,
may find all that they want in Dr. Clarke’s celebrated work on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>‘Attributes,’ which contains more logical acuteness and more power
of scholastic disputation than any other work that I know of in
modern times. Hartley has lost himself in the same endless labyrinth
of finite and infinite series. And Locke’s statement of this
question is only better, because it is shorter, and goes straight forward,
without stopping to answer difficulties.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ON TOOKE’S ‘DIVERSIONS OF PURLEY’</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>I would class the merits of Mr. Tooke’s work under three heads:
the etymological, the grammatical, and the philosophical. The
etymological part is excellent, the grammatical part indifferent, and
the philosophical part to the last degree despicable; it is downright,
unqualified, unredeemed nonsense. As Mr. Tooke himself says that
all metaphysical reasoning is nonsense, it is scarcely rude to say that
<em>his</em> metaphysical reasoning is so. It appears to me to be ‘mere midsummer
madness.’ He ought not indeed to have meddled with logic
or metaphysics after such a declaration; he ought to have supposed
that he laboured under some natural defect in this respect, as a man
who finds no harmony in any tune that is played to him, may without
much modesty conclude that he has no ear for music.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opinion which I have here advanced of this writer’s merits as
a general reasoner may seem a bold one; but the proof of it is not
difficult; it is as easy as transcribing. I have only to take a few
passages in which he has applied etymology to the illustration of
moral and metaphysical truth, to make his undistinguishing admirers
blush, not for their idol, but for the weakness and bounded faculties
of human nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tooke lays it down as a maxim, that the mind has neither
complex nor abstract ideas. He was in some things a zealot, and his
zeal had led him to believe that his system of etymology would in
some way or other establish this metaphysical principle, and overturn
the established notions of law, morality, philosophy, and divinity.
The full development and execution of this project is reserved for a
future volume, but there are perpetual hints and intimations of it in
the two first, something like the aerial music and flying noises in
Prospero’s island. The author seems constantly in his own mind on
the point of detecting all imposture and delusion with the Ithuriel
spear of etymology, but he as constantly draws back, and postpones
his triumph. The second volume of the ‘Diversions’ consists chiefly
of about two thousand instances of the etymology of words, to prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>that there can be no abstract ideas: scarcely one of which two
thousand meanings is anything else but a more abstract idea than the
word was in general supposed to convey: for example, the word <em>loaf</em>
commonly stands for a pretty substantial, solid, tangible kind of an
idea, and is not suspected of any latent, very refined, abstracted
meaning. The author shows, on the contrary, that the word has no
such palpable, positive meaning, as the particular object to which we
apply it, but merely signifies something, any thing, raised or <em>lifted</em> up.
A singular method, surely, of reducing all general and abstract signs
to individual, physical objects! Yet we find this tiresome catalogue
of derivations concluded in this manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘And on this subject of <em>subaudition</em> I will at present exercise your
patience no farther: for my own begins to flag. You have now
instances of my doctrine in, I suppose, about a thousand words.
Their number may be easily increased. But I trust these are sufficient
to discard that imagined operation of the mind, which has been
termed <em>abstraction</em>: and to prove that what we call by that name, is
merely one of the contrivances of language, for the purpose of more
speedy communication.’—Page 396, vol. ii.</p>

<p class='c007'>How a thousand instances of words, signifying a common quality
or abstract idea, with something understood (<em>subauditum</em>), can be
supposed to discard that imagined operation of the mind called
abstraction, or in what subaudition differs from abstraction, or whether
there is not something <em>subintellectum</em>, as well as <em>subauditum</em>,—that is,
certain circumstances left out by the mind for the necessary progress
of thought, as well as in language, for its more speedy communication,—it
is not easy to guess. This farcical mummery, this inexplicable
dumb show, this emphatical insignificance, neither admits nor deserves
any answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only places in the work in which this wary reasoner has fairly
committed himself, and given an intelligible explanation of his mode
of applying his system to general questions, are in his account of the
words, <em>right and wrong</em>, <em>just and unjust</em>, in his list of metaphysical
nonentities, demonstrated to be such because they are expressed by
the past participles of certain verbs, and in his definition of Truth.
These, therefore, I shall give as specimens, and I hope they will be
quite satisfactory. The ‘Diversions of Purley,’ it should be observed,
is supposed to be carried on in a dialogue between the author and Sir
Francis Burdett.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Enough, enough,’ says Burdett, ‘innumerable instances of the
same may, I grant you, be given from all our ancient authors. But
does this import us any thing?’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> Surely, much, if it shall lead us to the clear understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the words we use in discourse. For as far as we “know not
our own meaning,” as far as “our purposes are not endowed with
words to make them known,” so far we “gabble like things most
brutish.” But the importance rises higher, when we reflect upon the
application of words to metaphysics. And when I say metaphysics,
you will be pleased to remember that all general reasoning, all politics,
law, morality, and divinity, are merely metaphysics.’ [What is this
general reasoning of Mr. Tooke’s?]</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Well,’ replies his pupil, ‘you have satisfied me that wrong, however
written, whether wrang, wrong or wrung, like the Italian <i><span lang="it">torto</span></i>
and the French <i><span lang="fr">tort</span></i>, is merely the past tense or participle of the verb
to wring; and has merely that meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> True; it means wrung or wrested from the <em>right</em> or
<em>ordered</em> line of conduct. Right is no other than <i><span lang="la">rectum</span></i>, the past
participle of the Latin verb <i><span lang="la">regere</span></i>. The Italian <i><span lang="it">dritto</span></i>, and the
French <i><span lang="fr">droit</span></i>, are no other than the past participle <i><span lang="la">directum</span></i>. In the
same manner our English word <em>just</em> is the past participle of the verb
<i><span lang="la">jubere</span></i> (<i><span lang="la">jussum</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> What, then, is law?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> It is merely the past participle <em>lag</em>, of the Gothic and
Anglo-Saxon verb <i><span lang="ang">legan</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">ponere</span></i>; and it means something or anything
<em>laid down</em> as a rule of conduct. Thus when a man demands his <em>right</em>,
he only asks that which it is <em>ordered</em> he shall have. A <em>right</em> conduct
is that which is ordered. A <em>right</em> line is that which is ordered or
directed, not a random extension, but the shortest between two points.
A <em>right</em> and <em>just</em> action is such a one as is ordered and commanded.
The right hand is that which custom, and those who have brought
us up, have ordered or directed us to use in preference, when one
hand only is employed, and the left hand is that which is <em>lieved</em>
or left.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> Surely the word <em>right</em> is sometimes used in some other
sense. And see, in this newspaper before us, M. Portalis, contending
for the <em>concordat</em>, says:—“The multitude are much more
impressed with what they are <em>commanded</em> to obey, than with what is
proved to them to be <em>right</em> and <em>just</em>.” This will be complete nonsense,
if <em>right</em> and <em>just</em> mean <em>ordered</em> and <em>commanded</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> I will not undertake to make sense of the arguments of
M. Portalis. The whole of his speech is a piece of wretched mummery,
employed to bring back again to France the more wretched
mummery of pope and popery. Writers on such subjects are not very
anxious about the meaning of their words. Ambiguity and equivocation
are their strongholds. Explanation would undo them.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> Well, but Mr. Locke uses the word in a manner hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to be reconciled with your account of it. He says:—“God has a
right to do it, we are his creatures.”</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> It appears to me highly improper to say, that God has
a right, as it is also to say that God is just. For nothing is ordered,
directed, or commanded concerning God. The expressions are inapplicable
to the Deity: though they are common, and those who use
them have the best intentions. They are applicable only to men, to
whom alone language belongs, and of whose sensations only words are
the representations; to men, who are by nature the subjects of orders
and commands, and whose chief merit is obedience.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> Every thing, then, that is ordered and commanded is
right and just.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> Surely; for that is only affirming that what is ordered
and commanded is—ordered and commanded.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> These sentiments do not appear to have made you very
conspicuous for obedience. There are not a few passages, I believe,
in your life, where you have opposed what was ordered and commanded.
Upon your own principles, was that <em>right</em>?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> Perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> How now! was it ordered and commanded that you
should oppose what was ordered and commanded? Can the same
thing be at the same time both right and wrong?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> Travel back to the island of Melinda, and you will find
the difficulty most easily solved. A thing may be at the same time
both <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em>, as well as <em>right</em> and <em>left</em>. It may be commanded
to be done, and commanded not to be done. The law, <em>i.e.</em>
that which is laid down, may be different by different authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I have always been most obedient when most taxed with disobedience.
But my right hand is not the right hand of Melinda.
The right I revere is not the right adored by sycophants, the <i><span lang="la">jus
vagum</span></i>, the capricious command of princes or ministers. I follow the
law of God (which is laid down by him for the rule of my conduct)
when I follow the laws of human nature: which, without any testimony,
we know must proceed from God, and upon these are founded
the rights of man, or what is ordered for man.’</p>

<p class='c007'>On this passage I will observe that I think it would be difficult for
Mr. Tooke himself to find a more precious instance of unmeaning
jargon in the writings of any school-divine. Mr. Tooke first pretends
gravely to define the essence of <em>law</em> and <em>just</em> from the etymology of
those words, by saying that they are something <em>laid down</em> and something
<em>ordered</em>; and when pressed by the difficulty that there are
many things laid down and many things ordered which are neither
‘law’ nor ‘just,’ makes answer that their obligation depends on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>higher species of law and justice, to wit, a law which is no where
laid down, and a justice which is no where ordered, except indeed by
the nature of things, on which the etymology of these two words does
not seem to throw much light. At one time, it seems quite demonstrable
that the essence of all law, right, and justice consists in its being
ordered or communicated by words: the very idea is absurd, unless we
conceive of it as some thing either spoken or written in a book; and
yet the very next moment this fastidious reasoner sets up the unwritten,
uncommunicated law of God, which he says must conform to the
laws of human nature, as the rule of his conduct, and as paramount
to all other positive orders and commands whatever. What is this
original law of God or nature, which Mr. Tooke sets up as the rule
of right? Is it the good of the whole, or self-interest? Is it the
voice of reason, or conscience, or the moral sense? Here then we
have to set out afresh in our pursuit, and to grope our way as well
as we can through the old labyrinth of morality, divinity, and metaphysics.
This new-invented patent lamp of etymology goes out just
as it is beginning to grow dark, and as the path becomes intricate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither can I at all see why our author should quarrel with
M. Portalis for using these words in their common sense. He affirms
that the whole of this gentleman’s speech is a piece of wretched
mummery, that his distinction between what is right and what is
commanded is a senseless ambiguity, and that explanation would undo
him. Yet he himself, two pages after, discovers that this distinction
has a real meaning in it, and that he has acted upon it all his life.
‘The one,’ he says, ‘is the <i><span lang="la">jus vagum</span></i>, the capricious command of
princes; the other is the law of God and nature.’ It is not impossible
but M. Portalis might have given quite as profound an explanation of
his own meaning. Junius’s sarcasm did not, it seems, entirely cure
Mr. Tooke ‘of the little sneering sophistries of a collegian.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tooke next makes strange havoc with a whole host of metaphysical
agents; like Sir Richard Blackmore,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Undoes creation at a jerk,</div>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Rebelling angels, the forbidden tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heaven, hell, earth, chaos, all’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>are weighed in the balance and found wanting. We cannot say with
Marvell, that the argument</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Holds us a while misdoubting his intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he would ruin (for I saw him strong)</div>
      <div class='line'>The sacred truths to fable and old song.</div>
      <div class='line'>(So Sampson groped the temple’s posts in spite)</div>
      <div class='line'>The world o’erwhelming to revenge his sight.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>For Mr. Tooke leaves us in no doubt about his intent. All these
sacred truths are, according to him, so many falsehoods, which by
taking possession of certain adjectives and participles, have palmed
themselves upon the world as realities, but which, by spelling their
names backwards, he proposes to exorcise and reduce to their original
nothingness again. Here follows a list of them which he has strung
together, as a warning to all other pseudo-substantives. It is rather
strange, by the bye, that the author should have resorted to this mode
of argument, since he affirms that adjectives are the names of things,
as well as substantives; and laughs at Dr. South for saying that they
are the names of nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘These words, these participles and adjectives,’ says Mr. Tooke,
‘not understood as such, have caused a metaphysical jargon and a
false morality, which can only be dissipated by etymology. And
when they come to be examined you will find that the ridicule which
Dr. Conyers Middleton has so justly bestowed upon the papists for
their absurd coinage of saints, is equally applicable to ourselves and to
all other metaphysicians; whose moral deities, moral causes, and
moral qualities are not less ridiculously coined and imposed upon
their followers.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>as well as <em>just</em>, <em>right</em>, and <em>wrong</em>, are all merely participles poetically
embodied and substantiated by those who use them.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘So Church, for instance (<i><span lang="la">Dominicum aliquid</span></i>) is an adjective;
and formerly a most wicked one: whose misinterpretation caused
more slaughter and pillage of mankind than all the other cheats
together.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Francis says, ‘Something of this sort I can easily perceive,
but not to the extent you carry it. I see that those sham deities,
Fate and Destiny, <span lang="la">aliquid <em>fatum</em></span>, <span lang="fr">quelque chose <em>destinée</em></span>, are merely
the past participles of <i><span lang="la">fari</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr">destiner</span></i>. That Chance (“high
arbiter,” as Milton calls him) and his twin-brother Accident are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>merely the participles of <i><span lang="fro">escheoir</span></i>, <i><span lang="fro">cheoir</span></i>, and <i><span lang="la">cadere</span></i>. And that to say,
it befell me by chance or by accident, is absurdly saying it befell me
by falling.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I agree with you, that Providence, Prudence, Innocence, Substance,
and all the rest of that tribe of qualities (in <em>ence</em> and <em>ance</em>) are
merely the neuter plurals of the present participles of <i><span lang="la">ordere</span></i>, <i><span lang="la">nocere</span></i>,
<em>stare</em>, &#38;c. &#38;c. That Angel, Saint, Spirit, are the past participles
<span lang="grc">αγγελλειυ</span>, sanciri, spirare. That the Italian <em>cucolo</em>, a cuckoo, gives
us the verb to cucol, and its past participle cuckold.’</p>

<p class='c007'>And what if it does: will Mr. Tooke therefore pretend to say
that there is no such thing? This is indeed turning etymology to a
good account. It is clearing off old scores with a vengeance, and
establishing morality on an entirely new basis. For my own part,
I can only say of the whole of the reasoning of this author, with
Voltaire’s Candide, ‘<i><span lang="fr">la tête me tourne: on ne sait ou l’on est</span></i>.’ Whether
any or all of those metaphysical beings enumerated by Mr. Tooke do
or do not exist, what their nature or qualities are, whether modes,
relatives, substances, I shall not here undertake to determine, but I
do conceive that none of these questions can be resolved in any way
by inquiring whether the names denoting them are not the past
participles of certain verbs. A shorter method would I think be to
say at once that all metaphysical and moral terms, whether participles
or not, are but names, that names are not things, and that therefore
the things themselves have no existence. It is upon this philosophical
principle that the heroical Jonathan Wild proceeds in his definition of
the word Honour, for after losing himself to no purpose in the
common metaphysical jargon on the subject, and in moral causes and
qualities, he comes at last to this clear and unembarrassed conclusion,—‘That
honour consists in the word <em>honour</em>, and nothing else.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I will only give one instance more of this reformed system of logic
and metaphysics.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Burdett.</span> I still wish for an explanation of one word more:
which on account of its extreme importance ought not to be omitted.
What is Truth? You know when Pilate had asked the same
question, he went out and would not stay for an answer, and from
that time to this no answer has been given. And from that time to
this mankind have been wrangling and tearing each other to pieces
for the truth, without once considering the meaning of the word.’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<span class='sc'>Tooke.</span> This word will give us no trouble. Like the other
words, <em>true</em> is also a past participle of the Saxon verb <em>treowan</em>, confidere,
to think, to believe firmly, to be thoroughly persuaded of, to
trow. <em>True</em>, as we now write it, or <em>trew</em>, as it was formerly written,
means simply and merely that which is trowed, and instead of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>being a rare commodity upon earth, except only in words, there is
nothing but truth in the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘That every man, in his communication with others, should speak
that which he troweth, is of so great importance to mankind, that it
ought not to surprise us, if we find the most extravagant and
exaggerated praises bestowed upon truth. But truth supposes mankind;
for whom and by whom alone the word is formed, and to
whom only it is applicable. If no man, no truth. There is therefore
no such thing as eternal, immutable, everlasting truth; unless
mankind, such as they are at present, be also eternal, immutable, and
everlasting. Two persons may contradict each other, and yet both
speak truth. For the truth of one person may be opposite to the
truth of another. To speak truth may be a vice as well as a virtue;
for there are many occasions when it ought not to be spoken. If you
reject my explanation, find out if you can some other possible meaning
of the word, or content yourself with Johnson, by saying that <em>true</em>
is not false, and <em>false</em> is—not true. For so he explains the words.’—Vol.
ii. p. 407.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a note the author adds, ‘Mr. Locke, in the second book of his
Essay, chapter xxxii., treats of <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> ideas, and is much
distressed throughout the whole chapter, because he had not in his
mind any determinate meaning of the word <em>true</em>. If that excellent
man had himself followed the advice which he gave to his disputing
friends concerning the word <em>liquor</em>; if he had followed his own rule,
previously to writing about <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> ideas, and had determined
what meaning he applied to <em>true</em>, <em>being</em>, <em>thing</em>, <em>real</em>, <em>right</em>, <em>wrong</em>, he
could not have written the above chapter, which exceedingly distresses
the reader, who searches for a meaning where there is none to be
found.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether Mr. Locke would have been satisfied with Mr. Tooke’s
account of these words, I cannot say. I know that I am not. I do
not think it the true one. It is therefore not the true one. Mr.
Tooke thinks it is, and therefore it is the true one. Which of us is
right? That what a man thinks, he thinks, and that if he speaks
what he thinks, he speaks truth in one principal sense of the word, is
what does not require much illustration; but whether what he thinks
is true or false, whether his opinion is right or wrong, or whether
there is not another possible and actual meaning of the terms besides
that given by Mr. Tooke, is the old difficulty, which remains just
where it was before, in spite of etymology.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of the theory of language to the philosophy of the
mind, Mr. Tooke has reserved for a volume by itself: the principle,
however, which he means to establish, he has very explicitly laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>down in the beginning of his first volume. ‘The business of the
mind,’ he says, ‘as far as it concerns language, appears to me to be
very simple. It extends no farther than to receive impressions, that
is, to have sensations or feelings. What are called its operations, are
merely the operations of language. The greatest part of Mr. Locke’s
Essay, that is, all which relates to what he calls the <em>composition</em>, <em>abstraction</em>,
<em>complexity</em>, <em>generalization</em>, <em>relation</em>, &#38;c. of ideas, does indeed
merely concern language. If he had been sooner aware of the
inseparable connexion between words and knowledge, he would not
have talked of the composition of ideas; but would have seen that the
only composition was in the terms; and consequently that it was as
improper to talk of a complex idea as of a complex star. It is an
easy matter, upon Mr. Locke’s own principles and a physical consideration
of the senses and the mind, to prove the impossibility of the
composition of ideas; and that they are not ideas, but merely terms
which are general and abstract.’—Vol. i. pp. 39, 51, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now I grant that Mr. Locke’s own principles, and a physical consideration
of the mind, do lead to the conclusion here stated, that is,
to an absurdity; and it is from thence I have endeavoured to show
more than once that those principles, and the considering the mind as
a physical thing, are themselves absurd. How a term can be complex
otherwise than from the complexity of its meaning, that is, of the
idea attached to it, is difficult to understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the other position, that we have no general ideas, but that it is
the terms only that are general and abstract, Mr. Tooke has borrowed
this piece of philosophy from Mr. Locke, who borrowed it from
Hobbes. ‘Universality’ says Mr. Locke, as quoted by our author,
‘belongs not to things, which are all of them particular in their existence.
When, therefore, we quit particulars, the generals that rest are
only creatures of our own; their general nature being nothing but the
capacity they are put into of signifying or representing many particulars.’
I have, however, before shown how very loose, uncertain, and
wavering, Mr. Locke’s reasoning on this subject is, though I cannot
agree with Mr. Tooke that it is therefore ‘<em>very different from that incomparable
author’s usual method of proceeding</em>.’ There is one question
which may be asked with respect to this statement, which, if fairly
answered, will perhaps, decide the point in dispute: <em>viz.</em> if there is
no general nature in things, or if we have no general idea of what they
have in common or the same, how is it that we know when to apply the
same general terms to different particulars, which on this principle will
have nothing left to connect them together in the mind? For example,
take the words, <em>a white horse</em>. Now say they, it is the terms which
are general or common, but we have no general or abstract idea corresponding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>to them. But if we had no general idea of <em>white</em>, nor any
general idea of <em>a horse</em>, we should have nothing more to guide us in
applying this phrase to any but the first horse, than in applying the terms
of an unknown tongue to their respective objects. For it is the idea of
something general or common between the several objects, which can
alone determine us in assigning the same name to things which, considered
as particulars, or setting aside that general nature, are perfectly
distinct and independent. Without this link in the mind, this general
perception of the qualities of things, the terms <em>a white horse</em> could no
more be applied, and would, in fact, be no more applicable to animals of
this description generally, than to any other animal. In short, what
is it that ‘puts the same common name into a capacity of signifying many
particulars,’ but that those particulars are, and are conceived to be of the
same kind? That is, general terms necessarily imply a class of things
and ideas. Language without this would be reduced to a heap of proper
names: and we should be just as much at a loss to name any object
generally, from its agreement with others, as to know whether we
should call the first man we met in the street by the name of John or
Thomas. The existence and use of general terms is alone a sufficient
proof of the power of abstraction in the human mind; nor is it
possible to give even a plausible account of language without it. But
Mr. Tooke has on all possible occasions sacrificed common sense to a
false philosophy and epigrammatic logic. In opposition to this author’s
assertion, that we have neither complex nor abstract ideas, I think it
may be proved to a demonstration that we have no others. If our
ideas were absolutely simple and individual, we could have no idea of
any of those objects which in this erring, half-thinking philosophy are
called individual, as a table or a chair, a blade of grass, or a grain of
sand. For every one of these includes a certain configuration, hardness,
colour, &#38;c. <em>i.e.</em> ideas of different things, and received by different
senses, which must be put together by the understanding before
they can be referred to any particular thing, or form one idea.
Without the cementing power of the mind, all our ideas would be
necessarily decomposed and crumbled down into their original elements
and flexional parts. We could indeed never carry on a chain of
reasoning on any subject, for the very links of which this chain must
consist, would be ground to powder. No two of these atomic impressions
could ever club together to form even a sensible point, much
less should we be able ever to arrive at any of the larger masses, or
nominal descriptions of things. All nature, all objects, all parts of all
objects would be equally ‘without form and void.’ <em>The mind alone is
formative</em>, to borrow the expression of a celebrated German writer, or
it is that alone which by its pervading and elastic energy unfolds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>expands our ideas, that gives order and consistency to them, that
assigns to every part its proper place, and that constructs the idea of
the whole. Ideas are the offspring of the understanding, not of the
senses. In other words, it is the understanding alone that perceives
relation, but every object is made up of a bundle of relations. In
short, there is no object or idea which does not consist of a number
of parts arranged in a certain manner, but of this arrangement the
parts themselves cannot be conscious. A ‘physical consideration of
the senses and the mind’ can never therefore account for our ideas,
even of sensible objects. Mr. Locke’s own principles do indeed exclude
all power of understanding from the human mind. The manner
in which Hobbes and Berkeley have explained the nature of mathematical
demonstration upon this system shows its utter inadequacy to
any of the purposes of general reasoning, and is a plain confession of
the necessity of abstract ideas. Mr. Hume considers the principle
that abstraction is not an operation of the mind, but of language, as one
of the most capital discoveries of modern philosophy, and attributes it
to Bishop Berkeley. Berkeley has however only adopted the arguments
and indeed almost the very words of Hobbes. The latter
author in the passage which has been already quoted says, ‘By this
imposition of names, some of larger, some of stricter signification, we
turn the reckoning of the consequences of things imagined in the mind
into a reckoning of the consequences of appellations. For example,
a man that hath no use of speech at all, such as is born and remains
perfectly deaf and dumb, if he set before his eyes a triangle, and by it
two right angles, (such as are the corners of a square figure) he may
by meditation compare and find that the three angles of that triangle
are equal to those two right angles that stand by it. But if another
triangle be shewn him different in shape from the former, he cannot
know without a new labour, whether the three angles of that also be
equal to the same. But he that hath the use of words, when he observes
that such equality was consequent not to the length of the sides,
nor to any other particular thing in his triangle, but only to this, that
the sides were straight and the angles three, and that that was all for
which he named it a triangle, will boldly conclude universally, that
such equality of angles is in all triangles whatsoever; and register his
invention in these general terms: <em>Every triangle hath its three angles
equal to two right ones</em>. And thus the consequence found in one particular,
comes to be registered and remembered as an universal rule;
and discharges our mental reckoning of time and place, and delivers
us from all labour of the mind saving the first, and makes that
which was found true <em>here</em> and <em>now</em> to be true <em>in all times</em> and <em>places</em>.’—<cite>Leviathan</cite>,
p. 14.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Bishop Berkeley gives the same view of the nature of abstract
reasoning in the introduction to his ‘Principles of Human Knowledge.’
‘But here,’ he says, ‘it will be demanded how we can know any proposition
to be true of all particular triangles, except we have first seen
it demonstrated of the abstract idea of a triangle, which agrees equally
to all. To which I answer, that though the idea I have in view,
whilst I make the demonstration be, for instance, that of an isosceles
rectangular triangle, whose sides are of a determinate length, I may
nevertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles of
what sort or bigness soever. And that because neither the right angle
nor the equality nor the determinate length of the sides are at all concerned
in the demonstration. ’Tis true, the diagram I have in view
includes all these particulars, but then there’s not the least mention
made of them in the proof of the proposition. It is not said the
three angles are equal to two right ones, because one of them is a
right angle, or because the sides comprehending it are of the same
length; which sufficiently shows that the right angle might have been
oblique and the sides unequal, and for all that the demonstration have
held good. And for this reason it is that I conclude that to be true
of any oblique angular or scalenon, which I had demonstrated of a
particular right angled equicrural triangle, and not because I demonstrated
the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle.’—Page 34.</p>

<p class='c007'>This answer does not appear to me satisfactory. It amounts to
this, that though the diagram we have in view includes a number of
particular circumstances, not applicable to other cases, yet we know
the principle to be true generally, because <em>there is not the least mention
made of these particulars in the proof of the proposition</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it is asserted that we must necessarily have the idea of a
particular size whenever we think of a man in general, all that is
intended I believe is that we must think of a particular height. This
idea it is supposed must be particular and determinate, just as we
must draw a line with a piece of chalk, or make a mark with the
slider of a measuring instrument in one place and not in another. I
think it may be shown that this view of the question is also extremely
fallacious and an inversion of the order of our ideas. The height of
the individual is thus resolved into the consideration of the lines
terminating or defining it, and the intermediate space of which it
properly consists is entirely overlooked. For let us take any given
height of a man, whether tall, short, or middle-sized, and let that
height be as visible as you please, I would ask whether the actual
length to which it amounts does not consist of a number of other
lengths, as if it be a tall man, the length will be six feet, and each of
these feet will consist of as many inches, and those inches will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>again made up of decimals, and those decimals of other subordinate
and infinitesimal parts, which must be all distinctly perceived and
added together before the sum total which they compose can be pretended
to be a distinct, particular, or individual idea. In any given
visible object we have always a gross, general idea of something
extended, and never of the precise length; for this precise length as
it is thought to be is necessarily composed of a number of lengths too
many, and too minute to be separately attended to or jointly conceived
by the mind, and at last loses itself in the infinite divisibility of matter.
What sort of distinctness or individuality can therefore be found in
any visible image or object of sense, I cannot well conceive: it seems
to me like seeking for certainty in the dancing of insects in the
evening sun, or for fixedness and rest in the motions of the sea. All
particulars are nothing but generals, more or less defined according to
circumstances, but never perfectly so. The knowledge of any finite
being rests in generals, and if we think to exclude all generality from
our ideas of things, as implying a want of perfect truth and clearness,
we must be constrained to remain in utter ignorance. Let any one
try the experiment of counting a flock of sheep driven fast by him,
and he will soon find his imagination unable to keep pace with the
rapid succession of objects; and his idea of a particular number slide
into the general notion of multitude: not that because there are more
objects than he can possibly count he will think there are none, or
that the word <em>flock</em> will present to his mind a mere name without any
idea corresponding to it. Every act of the attention, every object
we see or think of, offers a proof of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of this view of the subject to explain the difference
between the synthetical and analytical faculties, between generalization
and abstraction in the proper acceptation of this last word, between
common sense or feeling and understanding or reason, demands a
separate essay.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not think it possible ever to arrive at the truth upon these, or
to prove the existence of general or abstract ideas, by beginning in
Mr. Locke’s method with particular ones. This faculty of abstraction
or generalization (to use the words indifferently) is indeed by
most considered as a sort of artificial refinement upon our other ideas,
as an excrescence, no ways contained in the common impressions of
things, nor scarcely necessary to the common purposes of life; and is
by Mr. Locke altogether denied to be among the faculties of brutes.
It is the ornament and top-addition of the mind of man which proceeding
from simple sensation upwards, is gradually sublimed into the
abstract notions of things: ‘so from the root springs lighter the green
stalk, from thence the leaves more airy, last the bright consummate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>flower.’ On the other hand, I imagine that all our notions from first
to last are, strictly speaking, general and abstract, not absolute and
particular, and that this faculty mixes itself more or less with every
act of the mind, and in every moment of its existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, I conceive that the mind has not been fairly dealt with in
this and other questions of the same kind. The difficulty belonging
to the notion of abstraction or comprehension it is perhaps impossible
ever to clear up: but that is no reason why we should discard those
operations from the human mind any more than we should deny the
existence of motion, extension, or curved lines in nature, because we
cannot explain them. Matter alone seems to have the privilege of
presenting difficulties and contradictions at any time, which pass
current under the name of <em>facts</em>; but the moment any thing of this
kind is observed in the understanding, all the petulance of logicians is
up in arms. The mind is made the mark on which they vent all the
modes and figures of their impertinence; and metaphysical truth has
in this respect fared like the milk-white hind, the emblem of pure
faith, in Dryden’s fable, which</p>

<p class='c006'>The modern system of philosophy has one great advantage, which
makes it difficult to attack it with any hopes of success, namely, that
it is not founded on any of the prevailing opinions or natural feelings
of mankind. It rests upon a single principle—its boasted superiority
over all prejudice. Unsupported by facts or reason, it is by this
circumstance alone enabled to trample upon every dictate of the
understanding or feeling of the heart, as weak and vulgar prejudices.
In this alone it is secure and invulnerable. To this it owes its giant
power and dreaded name. Let the contradictions and fallacies contained
in the system be proved over and over again, still the answer
is ready:—all the objections made to it are resolved into <em>prejudice</em>.
Destitute of every other support, it staggers our faith in received
opinions by the hardihood of its assertions, and derives its claim to
implicit credence by the boldness of its defiance of all established
authority. Common sense is brought to the bar like an old offender,
and condemned without a hearing. Under the shelter of this presumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>there is no absurdity so great as not to be advanced with
impunity. There is no hypothesis, however gratuitous, however
inadequate, or however unfounded, that is not held up as the true
one, if it is but contrary to all observation and experience. The
grossest credulity succeeds to the most extravagant scepticism. From
being the slaves of authority we become the dupes of paradox.
Every opinion which is so absurd as never to have been affirmed
before is converted into an undeniable truth. Whoever dares to
question it, unawed by the authority on the one hand, and undazzled
by the novelty on the other, is considered as a person of a narrow
and bigoted understanding, and as relinquishing all claim to the
exercise of his reason. We are effectually deterred from protesting
against any of these ‘wise saws and modern instances’ by the dread
of being mixed up with the vulgar, and we dare not avoid the
common feelings of humanity lest we should be ridiculed as the dupes
of self-love, or of the whining cant of moralists. There is however
no bigotry so blind as that which is founded on a supposed exemption
from all prejudice. The mind in this case identifies every opinion of
its own with reason itself: and regarding the objections made to it as
proceeding from a jaundiced and distorted view of the case, it converts
them into the strongest confirmations of the depth and comprehensiveness
of its own views. There are accordingly no people so
little capable of reasoning as those who make the loudest pretensions
to it: and having assumed the name of Philosophers, are astonished
that any one should call their title in question.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have been led to make these observations from reading Helvetius’s
account of self-love, which is nothing but a series of misrepresentations
and assumptions of the question, and which can only have
imposed upon his readers from that tone of confidence and alertness
which men always have in attacking a received and long-established
principle, and a tacit and involuntary feeling that boldness of opinion
implies strength and independence of mind. A few examples will
show that this censure is well-founded. ‘What,’ says this author in
the beginning of his view of the question,—‘what is the human
understanding? It is the assemblage of his ideas. To what sort of
understanding do we give the name of talent? To the understanding
concentrated upon a single subject; that is to say to a large assemblage
of ideas of the same kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Now if there are no innate ideas, human understanding and genius
are only acquired; and both one and the other have the following
faculties for their principles:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘1. Physical sensibility; without which we could receive no
sensations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>‘2. Memory, that is to say, the faculty of recalling the sensations
received.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘3. The interest which we have in comparing our sensations
together, that is to say, in observing with attention the resemblances
and differences, the agreements and disagreements of several objects
amongst them. It is this interest which fixes the attention, and in
minds commonly well-organised, is the efficient cause of understanding.’</p>

<p class='c007'>It is added in a note, ‘To judge, according to M. Rousseau, is not
to feel. The proof of his opinion is that we have a faculty or power
which enables us to compare objects. Now this power according to
him cannot be the effect of physical sensibility. But,’ continues
Helvetius, ‘if Rousseau had more profoundly considered the question,
he would have perceived that this power (or faculty of understanding)
is no other than the interest itself which we have to compare these
objects, and that this interest takes its rise in the feeling of self-love,
which is the immediate effect of physical sensibility.’ This is the
author’s account of the understanding. It is bold and decided, but it
is not on that account either more or less true. It comes to this;
that the faculty or power of understanding is owing to the use we
have for such a faculty; or that we have a power of comparing our
sensations, because we have an interest in comparing them, and that
therefore this power is nothing but the effect of physical sensibility.
So that a man before he has any understanding, feeling the want of it,
supplies himself with this very necessary faculty by an act of the will,
and out of pure friendly regard to himself. The interest or desire to
fly might at this rate supply us with a pair of wings, or an effort of
curiosity might furnish us with a new sense, or an effort of self-interest
might enable a man to be in two places at once. All these consequences
might very easily follow, if we were only satisfied to believe
any extravagance of assertion, and to use words systematically without
either connexion or meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole of this writer’s argument against the existence of a
benevolent principle in the mind is founded either on a play of words,
or an arbitrary substitution of one feeling for another. He has
confounded, and does not even seem to have been aware of the
distinction between, self-love, considered as a rational principle of
action, or the voluntary and deliberate pursuit of our own good as
such, and that immediate interest or gratification which the mind
may have in the pursuit of any object either relating to ourselves or
others. He sometimes evidently considers the former of these, that
is, a deliberating, calculating, conscious selfishness, as the only rational
principle of action, and treats all other feelings as romance and folly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>or even denies their existence; while at other times he contends that
the most disinterested generosity, patriotism, and love of fame, are
equally and in the strictest sense self-love, because the pursuit of these
objects is connected with and tends immediately and intentionally
to the gratification of the individual who has an attachment to
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>After stating the sentiment of Rousseau, that without an innate and
abstract sense of right and wrong we should not see the just man and
the true citizen consult the public good to his own prejudice,
Helvetius goes on thus:—‘No one, I reply, has ever been found to
promote the public good when it injured his own interest. The
patriot who risks his life to crown himself with glory, to gain the
public esteem, and to deliver his country from slavery, yields to the
feeling which is most agreeable to him. Why should he not place
his happiness in the exercise of virtue, in the acquisition of public
respect, and in the pleasure consequent upon this respect? For what
reason, in a word, should he not expose his life for his country, when
the sailor and soldier, the one at sea, and the other in the trenches,
daily expose theirs for a shilling? The virtuous man who seems to
sacrifice his own good to that of the public is only governed by a
sentiment of noble self-interest. Why should M. Rousseau deny
here that interest is the exclusive and universal motive of action, when
he himself admits it in a thousand places of his work?’ The author
then quotes the following passage from Rousseau’s ‘Emilius’ in
support of his doctrine:—‘A man may indeed pretend to prefer my
interest to his own: however plausibly he colours over this falsehood,
I am quite sure it is one.’ But I would ask why, on the principle
just stated by Helvetius, he should not prefer another to himself, ‘if
it is agreeable to him?’ Why should he not place his happiness in
the exercise of friendship? Why should he not risk his life for his
friend, as well as the patriot for his country, or as the soldier or
sailor for a shilling a day? What is become, all of a sudden, of that
noble self-interest which identifies us with our country and our kind?
Is it quite forgot? Has it evaporated with a breath? Is there
nothing of it left? When any instances are brought, or supposed, of
the sacrifice of private interest to principle, or virtue, or passion, it is
immediately pretended that these instances are not at all inconsistent
with the grand universal principle of self-interest, which embraces all
the sentiments and affections of the human mind, even the most
heroical and disinterested. But the moment these instances are out
of sight and the evasion is no longer necessary, this expansive
principle shrinks into its own natural littleness again; and excludes
all regard to the good of others as romantic and idle folly. All those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>instances of virtue which are at one moment perfectly compatible with
this ‘universal principle of action’ are the next moment said to be
incompatible with it, and the author after his little rhetorical glozings
on the extensive views and generous sacrifices of self-interest, immediately
descends into the vulgar proverb that ‘the misfortunes of
others are but a dream.’ To proceed: Helvetius says, (p. 14):</p>

<p class='c007'>‘What we understand by goodness or the moral sense in man, is
his benevolence towards others: and this benevolence we always find
in proportion to the utility they are of to him. I prefer my fellow-citizens
to strangers, and my friend to my fellow-citizens. The
welfare of my friend is reflected upon me. If he becomes more rich
and more powerful, I partake of his riches and his power. Benevolence
towards others is nothing, then, but the effect of love to
ourselves.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The inference here stated, that benevolence is merely a reflection
from self-love, is founded on the assumption that we always feel for
others in proportion to the advantage they are of to us, and this
assumption is a false one. That the habitual or known connexion
between our own welfare and that of others, is one great source of
our attachment to them, one bond of society, is what I do not wish
to deny: the question is whether it is the only one in the mind, or
whether benevolence has not a natural basis of its own to rest upon,
as well as self-love. Grant this, and the actual effects which we
observe in human life will follow from both principles combined: but
to say that our attachment to others is in the exact ratio of our
obligations to them, is contrary to all we know of human nature. I
would ask whether the affection of a mother for her child is owing to
the good received or bestowed; to the child’s power of conferring
benefits, or its standing in need of assistance? Are not the fatigues
which the mother undergoes for the child, its helpless condition, its
little vexations, its sufferings from ill health or accidents, additional
ties upon maternal tenderness, which by increasing the attention to the
wants of the child and anxiety to supply them, produce a proportionable
interest in an attachment to its welfare? Helvetius justly
observes that we prefer a friend to a stranger, but the reason which
he assigns for it, that our interests and pleasures are more closely
allied, is not the only one. We participate in the successes of our
friends, it is true, but we also participate in their distresses and disappointments,
and it is not always found that this lessens our regard
for them. Benevolence, therefore, is not a mere physical reflection
from self-love. His account of friendship agrees exactly with that
which the grave historian of Jonathan Wild has given of the friendship
between his hero and Count La Ruse: ‘Mutual interest, the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of all purposes, was the cement of this alliance, which nothing of
consequence but superior interest was capable of dissolving.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The mechanical principle of association, understood in a strict
sense, will not account for the multifarious and mixed nature of our
affections, and if we do not understand it in a strict sense, it will
then only be another name for sympathy, imagination, or any thing
else.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘What then in truth,’ proceeds this author, ‘is the natural goodness,
or moral sense, so much extolled by the English? What
distinct idea can we form of such a sense, or on what evidence found
its existence? If we allow a moral sense, why not allow an
algebraical or chemical sense? Nothing is more absurd than this
theological philosophy of Shaftesbury, and yet most of the English
are as much delighted with it as the French formerly were with their
music. It is not the same with other nations. No foreigner can
understand the one or hear the other. It is a film on the eye of
the English, which it is necessary to remove in order that they
may see.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘According to their philosophy, a man in a state of indifference
sitting in his elbow chair, desires the good of others: but in as far
as he is indifferent, man desires and can desire nothing. A state of
desire and indifference is incompatible. These philosophers repeat in
vain that the moral sense is implanted in man, and makes him at a
certain time disposed to compassionate the sufferings of his fellows.
This system is in fact nothing more than the system of innate ideas
overturned by Locke. For my part, I can form an idea of my five
senses, and of the organs which constitute them: but I confess that
I have no more idea of a moral sense than of a moral elephant and
castle. The enthusiasts for “moral beauty” are ignorant of the
contempt in which these nations are held by all those who, either in
the character of statesmen, officers of police, or men of the world,
have an opportunity of knowing what human nature is.’—Page 15.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reply to the dogmatical question with which this passage begins—‘What
distinct idea can be given of the moral sense?’—I answer
for myself, the following very explicit one: namely, that it is the
natural preference of good to evil, arising from the conception or idea
formed of them in the understanding. Those who assert a moral
sense, affirm that there is a faculty of some sort or other inseparable
from the nature of a rational and intelligent being, that enables us to
form a conception of good and evil, or of the feelings of pleasure and
pain generally speaking, which ideas so formed have a natural tendency
to excite certain affections and actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those, on the other hand, who deny a moral sense, or any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>equivalent to it, must affirm either that we can form no idea whatever
of the feelings of others, or of good and evil generally speaking, or
that these ideas have no possible influence over the mind, except from
their connexion with physical impressions, memory, habit, self-interest,
or some other motive, quite distinct from the ideas themselves. But
I have already shown that without the co-operation of rational motives,
there could be neither habit, nor self-interest, nor voluntary action of
any kind. The moral is therefore nothing but the application of the
understanding to the feelings or ideas of good. The question,
consequently, whether there is a moral sense, is reducible to this;
whether the mind can understand or conceive, or be affected by any
thing beyond its own physical or mechanical feelings. If it can, then
there is something in man besides his five senses and the organs
which compose them, for these can give him no thought, conception,
or sympathy with any thing beyond himself, or even with himself
beyond the present moment. The actions, and events, and feelings
of human life, the passions and pursuits of men, could no more go on
without the interference of the understanding than without an original
principle of physical sensibility. Neither the one nor the other
explains the whole economy of our moral nature, but that is no reason
why both are not essential and integrant parts of it. The five senses
and the organs which compose them will not account for the science
of morality, let it be as imperfect as it may, any more than for the
science of algebra or chemistry in the different degrees in which they
are possessed by different men. The point is not whether reason is
furnishing us with a perfect and infallible rule of action, absolute over
any other motive or passion, but whether it is any rule at all, whether
it has any possible influence over our moral feelings. According to
Helvetius, the moral sense is either a word without meaning, or it
must signify one of our five senses: that is, impressions not actually
affecting one or other of these are to him absolutely nothing. It is
strange that after this he should propose to take the film from the eyes
of those who ridiculously fancy that they have other ideas. It is as
if a blind man should undertake to undeceive those who can see, with
respect to certain chemical notions, called objects of sight. In confirmation
of his theory, he refers the romantic admirers of moral
beauty to the opinion of certain classes and professions of men, whose
visual ray has been purged, and who, it should seem, possess a sort of
second sight into human nature, namely, ministers of state, officers of
police, and men of business. Either this argument is a satire on these
characters, or on the understanding of his readers. If these respectable,
and, I dare say, very well-meaning persons, are by the narrowness
of their occupations and views, precluded from any general knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>of human nature, or the virtues of the human heart, it is an uncivil
irony to propose them as consummate judges of the abstract nature of
man. If, on the other hand, in spite of their employment, they
retain the same notions and liberality of feeling as other men, there is
no reason to suppose that they would subscribe to the sentiment of our
author, that morality ‘is an affair of the five senses:’ a proposition
which any minister of state, or police officer, or man of the world,
possessed of the least common sense, would treat with as much contempt
and incredulity as Shaftesbury or Hutcheson. Our author’s
observation, that the notion of a moral sense or natural disposition to
sympathise with others, is only the doctrine of innate ideas in disguise,
is another misconception of the nature of the question. The actual
feeling of compassion is not, as he says, innate; but this no more
proves that the disposition to compassion or benevolence is not innate,
than the fact that the ideas or feelings of pleasure and pain are not
innate and born with us, proves that physical sensibility is not an
original faculty of the mind. Moral sensibility, or the capacity of
being affected by the ideas of certain objects, is as much a part of
our nature as physical sensibility, or the capacity of being affected
in a certain manner by the objects themselves. Helvetius says,
physical sensibility is the only quality essential to the nature of man:
I answer, that physical sensibility is <em>not</em> the only quality essential to
the nature of man. To show how senseless and insignificant is this
kind of reasoning, I will refer back to Helvetius’s concise profession
of his metaphysical faith, which is that he can form an idea of the
five senses and of the organs of them, but of nothing else. Now,
I may ask, how he comes by this <em>idea</em>? Which of his senses or which
of the organs of them is it that gives him an idea of the other four?
Has the eye an action of words, or the ear of colours, or either of
the impressions of taste, smell, or feeling? Which of them is the
common sense? or if none, must we not suppose some superintending
faculty to which all the other impressions are subject, and which alone
can give him an idea of his own senses or their organs? Another
instance of the utter want of logical and consecutive reasoning which
characterizes the French philosophers, might be given in their singular
proof of the selfishness of the human mind from the incompatibility of
a state of desire and a state of indifference. The English philosophers
are charged with representing a man in a state of indifference, ‘seated
in his arm-chair,’ as desiring the good of others. This arm-chair
it should seem, no less than his state of indifference, presents certain
insurmountable barriers to his desires, which they cannot pass so as to
affect him with the slightest concern for any thing beyond it. So far
as a man is indifferent to every thing, he cannot it is true desire any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>thing. All that follows from this is, that so far as he desires the
good of others he is not in a state of indifference.</p>

<p class='c007'>That a man cannot desire an object and not desire it at the same
time requires no proof. But what ought to have been proved, and
what was meant to be so, is that a man in a state of indifference to
the welfare of others on his own account, cannot desire it for their
sake, and this is what is not proved by the truism mentioned. The
general maxim, that I cannot desire any object as long as I am
indifferent to it, cannot be made to show that self-interest is the only
motive that can make me pass from the one state into the other. By
indifference, as used by the writers here ridiculed, in a popular sense,
is evidently meant the want of personal or physical interest in any
object, and to say that this necessarily implies the want of every other
kind of interest in it, of all rational desire of the good of others, is a
meagre assumption of the point in dispute. It is strange that these
pretenders to philosophy choose to insult the English writers for
daring to wear the plain, homely, useful, national garb of philosophy,
while their most glossy and most fashionable suits are made up of the
shreds and patches stolen from our countryman Hobbes, disguised
with a few spangles, tinselled lace, and tagged points of their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Helvetius’s paraphrase of Hobbes’s maxim, that ‘pity is only
another name for self-love,’ is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘What then do I feel in the presence of an object of compassion?
A strong emotion. What causes this emotion? The recollection of
the sufferings to which man is subject, and to which I am myself
liable. It is this consideration that disturbs, that torments me, and
so long as the unfortunate sufferer continues in my presence I am
affected with melancholy sensations. Have I relieved him,—do I no
longer see him? A calm is insensibly restored to my breast, because
in proportion to the distance to which he is removed, the remembrance
of the evils which his sight recalled is gradually effaced. When
I was concerned for him, then, I was concerned only for myself.
What are, in fact, the sufferings which I compassionate the most?
They are those not only which I have felt myself, but those which I
may still feel. Those evils the more present to my memory impress
me more strongly. My sympathy with the sufferings of another is
always in exact proportion to my fear of being exposed to the same
sufferings myself. I would willingly, if it were possible, destroy the
very germ of my own sufferings in him, and thus be released from
the apprehension of the like evils to myself in time to come. The
love of others is never any thing more in the human mind than the
effect of love to ourselves, and consequently of our physical sensibility.’—Vol.
ii. page 20.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>To this I answer as follows:—What do I feel in the presence of
an object of compassion? A strong emotion. What causes this
emotion? Not, certainly, the general recollection of the sufferings to
which man in general is subject, or to which I myself may be exposed.
It is not this remote and accidental reflection, which has no particular
reference to the object before me, but a strong sense of the sufferings
of the particular person, excited by his immediate presence, which
affects me with compassion, and impels me to his relief. The relief
I afford him, or the absence of the object, lessens my uneasiness,
either by the contemplation of the diminution of his sufferings, to
which I have contributed, or by diverting my mind from the consideration
of his sufferings. Neither the relief afforded, nor the
absence of the object could produce this effect, if the strong emotion
which I experience did not relate to the particular object. It is the
fate of the individual, and of him only, which I am contemplating,
and my sympathy accordingly rises and falls with it, or as my attention
is more or less fixed upon it. A total alteration in the situation of the
individual produces a total change in my feelings with respect to him,
which could not be the case, if my compassion depended wholly on my
sense of my own security, or the general condition of human nature.
In feeling compassion for another, therefore, it was not for myself that
I was concerned, but for the sufferer: my feelings were, in a manner,
bound up with his, and I forgot for the moment both myself and
others. But do I not compassionate most those evils which I have
felt myself? Yes; because from my own knowledge of them I have
a more lively sense of what others must suffer from them: just in the
same manner I dread those evils most with respect to myself in time
to come. For those evils which I have not experienced, I feel, for
that reason, less sympathy in respect to others, and less dread with
reference to myself in time to come. Neither do I always feel for
others in proportion as I dread the same feelings myself. The
memory of my past sufferings cannot excite my disposition to relieve
those of others, and the imaginary apprehension of my own <em>future</em>
sufferings can only tend to produce voluntary action on the same
principle as my imagination of those or others. I do not wish to
prevent their sufferings as the germ or cause of mine, but because they
are of the same nature as mine. Benevolence, therefore, is not the
effect of self love, though it is the effect of our physical sensibility,
combined with our other faculties. I will in this place insert the
reply of Bishop Butler (a true philosopher) to the same argument in
Hobbes, in a note to one of his sermons.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘If any person can in earnest doubt whether there be such a thing
as good-will in one man towards another (for the question is not concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>either the degree or extensiveness of it, but concerning the
affection itself,) let it be observed, that <em>whether man be thus or otherwise
constituted, what is the inward frame in this particular</em> is a mere
question of fact or natural history, not proveable immediately by
reason. It is therefore to be judged of and determined in the same
way other facts or historical matters are; by appealing to the external
senses, or inward perceptions, respectively, as the matter under consideration
is cognizable by one or the other; by arguing from
acknowledged facts and actions, inquiring whether these do not
suppose and prove the matter in question so far as it is capable of
proof. And, lastly, by the testimony of mankind. Now that there
is some degree of benevolence amongst men, may be as strongly and
plainly proved in all these ways, as it could possibly be proved,
supposing there was this affection in our nature. And should any
one think fit to assert, that resentment in the mind of man was absolutely
nothing but reasonable concern for our own safety, the falsity of
this, and what is the real nature of that passion, could be shown in no
other ways than those in which it may be shown, that there is such a
thing in <em>some degree</em> as <em>real</em> good-will in man towards man.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There being manifestly this appearance of men’s substituting others
for themselves, and being carried out and affected towards them as
towards themselves; some persons, who have a system which excludes
every affection of this sort, have taken a pleasant method to solve it;
and tell you it is <em>not another</em> you are at all concerned about, but your
<em>self only</em>, when you feel the affection called compassion; <em>i.e.</em> there is
a plain matter of fact, which men cannot reconcile with the general
account they think fit to give of things; they therefore, instead of
<em>that</em> manifest fact, substitute <em>another</em>, which is reconcilable to their
own scheme. For does not every body by compassion mean an
affection the object of which is another in distress? Instead of this,
but designing to have it mistaken for this, they speak of an affection
or passion, the object of which is ourselves, or danger to ourselves.
Suppose a person to be in real danger, and by some means or other to
have forgot it; any trifling accident, any sound might alarm him,
recall the danger to his remembrance, and renew his fears: but it is
almost too grossly ridiculous (though it is to show an absurdity) to
speak of that sound or accident as an object of compassion; and yet,
according to Mr. Hobbes, our greatest friend in distress is no more to
us, no more the object of compassion or of any affection in our heart.
Neither the one nor the other raises any emotion in our mind, but only
the thoughts of our liableness to calamity, and the fear of it: and both
equally do this.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There are often three distinct perceptions or inward feelings upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>sight of persons in distress: real sorrow and concern for the misery
of our fellow-creatures; some degree of satisfaction from a consciousness
of our freedom from that misery; and, as the mind passes on
from one thing to another, it is not unnatural from such an occasion to
reflect upon our own liableness to the same or other calamities. The
two last frequently accompany the first, but it is the first <em>only</em> which is
properly compassion, of which the distressed are the object, and which
directly carries us with calmness and thought to their assistance. Any
one of these, from various and complicated reasons, may in particular
cases prevail over the other two; and there are, I suppose,
instances where the bare <em>sight</em> of distress, without our feeling any
compassion for it, may be the occasion of either or both of the two
latter.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall proceed to examine the objection to the doctrine of benevolence,
on the supposition that our sympathy when it exists is really a
part of our interest. This objection was long ago stated by Hobbes,
Rochefoucault, and Mandeville, and has been adopted and glossed
over by Helvetius. It is pretended, then, that in wishing to relieve
the distresses of others we only desire to remove the uneasiness which
pity creates in our mind; that all our actions are unavoidably selfish,
as they all arise from the feeling of pleasure or pain existing in the
mind of the individual, and that whether we intend our own good or
that of others, the immediate gratification connected with the idea of
any object is the sole motive which determines us to the pursuit of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, this objection does not at all affect the main question in
dispute. For if it is allowed that the idea of the pleasures or pains
of others excites an immediate interest in the mind, if we feel sorrow
and anxiety for their imaginary distresses exactly in the same way
that we do for our own, and are impelled to action by the same principle,
whether the action has for its object our own good, or that of
others; in a word, if we sympathise with others as we do with ourselves,
the nature of man as a voluntary agent must be the same,
whether we choose to call this principle self-love, or benevolence, or
whatever refinements we may introduce into our manner of explaining
it. The relation of man to himself and others as a moral agent is
plainly determined, whether a rational pursuit of his own future welfare
and that of others is the real or only the ostensible motive of his
actions. Were it not that our feelings are so strongly attached to
names, the rest would be a question more of speculative curiosity than
practice. All that, commonly speaking, is meant by the most disinterested
benevolence is this immediate sympathy with the feelings
of others, as by self-love is meant the same kind of attachment to our
own future interests. For if by self-love we understand any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>beyond the impulse of the present moment, any thing different from
inclination, let the object be what it will, this can no more be a
mechanical thing than the most refined and comprehensive benevolence.
Self-love, used in the sense which the above objection implies, must
therefore mean some thing very different from an exclusive principle
of deliberate, calculating selfishness, rendering us indifferent to every
thing but our own advantage, or from the love of physical pleasure or
aversion to physical pain, which could produce no interest in any but
sensible impressions. In a word, it expresses merely any inclination
of the mind be it to what it will, and does not at all determine or
limit the object of pursuit. Supposing, therefore, that our most
generous feelings and actions were so far equivocal, the object only
bearing a show of disinterestedness, the secret motive being always
selfish, this would be no reason for rejecting the common use of the
term <em>disinterested benevolence</em>, which expresses nothing more than an
immediate reference of our actions to the good of others, as self-love
expresses a conscious reference of them to our own good as means to
an end. This is the proper meaning of the terms. If we denominate
our actions not from the object in view, but from the inclination of
the individual, there will be an end at once, both of ‘selfishness’ and
‘benevolence.’</p>

<p class='c007'>But farther, I deny that there is any foundation for the objection
itself, or any reason for resolving the feelings of compassion or our
voluntary motives in general into a principle of mechanical self-love.
That the motive to action exists in the mind of the person who acts,
is what no one can deny, or I suppose ever meant to deny. The
passion excited and the impression producing it must necessarily affect
the individual. There must always be some one to feel and act, or
there could evidently be no such thing as feeling or action. If therefore
it had ever been implied as a condition in the love of others, that
this love should not be felt by the person who loves them, this would
be to say that he must love them and not love them at the same time,
which is too palpable an absurdity to be thought of for a moment. It
could never, I say, be imagined that in order to feel for others, we
must in reality feel nothing, or that benevolence, to exist at all, must
exist no where. This kind of reasoning is therefore the most arrant
trifling. To call my motives or feelings selfish, because they are felt
by myself, is an abuse of all language: it might just as well be said
that my idea of the monument is a selfish idea, or an idea of myself,
because it is I who perceive it. By a selfish feeling must be meant,
therefore, a feeling, not which belongs to myself (for that all feelings
do, as is understood by every one) but which <em>relates</em> to myself, and
in this sense benevolence is not a selfish feeling. It is the individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>who feels both for himself and others; but by self-love is meant that
he feels only for himself; for it is presumed that the word <em>self</em> has
some meaning in it, and it would have absolutely none at all, if nothing
more were intended by it than any object or impression existing in
the mind. It therefore becomes necessary to set limits to the meaning
of the terms. If we except the burlesque interpretation of the word
just noticed, self-love can mean only one of these three things. 1. The
conscious pursuit of our own good as such; 2. The love of physical
pleasure and aversion to physical pain; 3. The gratification derived
from our sympathy with others. If all our actions do not proceed
from one of these three principles, they are all resolvable into self-love.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, then, self-love may properly signify, as already explained,
the love or affection excited by the idea of our own interest, and the
conscious pursuit of it as a general, remote, ideal object. In this
sense, that is, considered with respect to the proposed end of our
actions, I have shown sufficiently that there is no exclusive principle
of self-love in the human mind which constantly impels us, as a set
purpose, to pursue our own advantage and nothing but that.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, any being would be strictly a selfish agent, all whose
impulses were excited by mere physical pleasure or pain, and who had
no sense or imagination, or anxiety about any thing but its own bodily
feelings. Such a being could have no idea beyond its actual,
momentary existence, and would be equally incapable of rational
self-love or benevolence. But it is allowed on all hands that the
wants and desires of the human mind are not confined within the
limits of his bodily sensations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly, it is said that though man is not merely a physical agent,
but is naturally capable of being influenced by imagination and sympathy,
yet that this does not prove him to be possessed of any degree
of disinterestedness or real good-will to others; since he pursues the
good of others only from its contributing to his own gratification;
that is, not for their sakes, but for his own, which is still selfishness.
That is, the indulgence of certain affections necessarily tends, without
our thinking of it, to our own immediate gratification, and the impulse
to prolong a state of pleasurable feeling and put a stop to whatever
gives the mind the least uneasiness, is the real spring and over-ruling
principle of our actions. If our benevolence and sympathy with
others arose out of and was entirely regulated by this principle of
self-gratification, then these might indeed be with justice regarded as
the ostensible accidental motives of our actions, as the form or vehicle
which served only to transmit the efficacy of any other hidden principle,
as the mask and cover of selfishness. But the supposition itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>is the absurdest that can well be conceived. Self-love and sympathy
are inconsistent. The instant we no longer suppose man to be a
physical agent, and allow him to have ideas of things out of himself
and to be influenced by them, that is, to be endued with sympathy at
all, he must necessarily cease to be a merely selfish agent. The
instant he is supposed to conceive and to be affected by the ideas of
other things, he cannot be wholly governed by what relates to himself.
The terms ‘selfish’ and ‘natural agent’ are a contradiction. For
the one expression implies that the mind is actuated solely by the
impulse of self-love, and the other that it is in the power and under
the control of other motives. If our sympathy with others does not
always originate in the pleasure with which it is accompanied to
ourselves, or does not cease the moment it becomes troublesome to us,
then man is not entirely and necessarily the creature of self-love. He
is under another law and another necessity, and in spite of himself is
forced out of the direct line of his own interest, both future and
present, by other principles inseparable from his nature as an intelligent
being. Our sympathy therefore is not the servile, ready tool of our
self-love, but this latter principle is itself subservient to and over-ruled
by the former; that is, an attachment to others is a real independent
principle of human action. What I wish to state is this: that the
mind neither constantly aims at nor tends to its own individual
interest. That in benevolence, compassion, friendship, &#38;c. the mind
does aim at its good, is what every one must acknowledge. The only
sense then in which our sympathy with others can be construed into
self-love, must be that the mind is so constituted that without forethought
or any reflection in itself, or when seeming most occupied
with others, it is still governed by the same universal feeling of which
it is wholly unconscious; and that we indulge in compassion, &#38;c. only
because and in as far as it coincides with our own immediate gratification.
If it could be shown that the current of our desires always
runs the same way, either with or without knowledge, I should confess
that this would be a strong presumption of what has been called
the falsity of human virtue. But it is not true that such is the
natural disposition of the mind. It is not so constructed as to receive
no impressions but those which gratify its desire of happiness, or to
throw off every the least uneasiness relating to others, like oil from
water. It is not true that the feelings of others have no natural hold
upon the mind but by their connexion with self-interest. Nothing
can be more evident than that we do not on any occasion blindly
consult the interest of the moment; there is no instinctive unerring
bias to our own good, which in the midst of contrary motives and
doubtful appearances, puts aside all other impulses and guides them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>but to its own purposes. It is against all experience to say that in
giving way to the feelings of sympathy, any more than to those of
rational self-interest (for the argument is the same in both cases),
I always yield to that impulse which is accompanied with most
pleasure at the time. It is true that I yield to the strongest impulse,
but not that my strongest impulse is to pleasure. The idea, for
instance, of the relief I may afford to a person in extreme distress, is
not necessarily accompanied by a correspondent degree of pleasurable
sensation to counterbalance the painful sensation his immediate distress
occasions in my mind. It is certain that sometimes the one and
sometimes the other may prevail without altering my purpose in the
least. I am led to persevere in it by the idea of what are the
sufferings, and that it is in my power to alleviate them: though that
idea is not always the most agreeable contemplation I could have.
Those who voluntarily perform the most painful duties of friendship
or humanity do not do them from the immediate gratification arising
therefrom; it is as easy to turn away from a beggar as to relieve
him; and if the mind were not actuated by a sense of truth, and of
the real consequences of its actions, we should uniformly listen to the
distresses of others with the same sort of feeling as we go to see
a tragedy, only because we calculate that the pleasure is greater than
the pain. But I appeal to every one whether this is a true account of
human nature. There is indeed a false and bastard kind of feeling
commonly called sensibility, which is governed altogether by this
reaction of pity on our own minds, and which instead of disproving
only serves more strongly to distinguish the true. Upon the theory
here stated the mind is supposed to be imperceptibly attached to or to
fly from every idea or impression simply as it affects it with pleasure
or pain: all other impulses are carried into effect or remain powerless
according as they touch this great spring of human affection, which
determines every other movement and operation of the mind. Why
then do we not reject at first every tendency to what may give us
pain? Why do we sympathise with the distresses of others at all?</p>

<p class='c016'>Why does not our self-love in like manner, if it is so perfectly
indifferent and unconcerned a principle as it is represented, immediately
disentangle itself from every feeling or idea which it finds becoming
painful to it? It should seem we are first impelled by self-love to feel
uneasiness at another’s sufferings, in order that the same principle of
tender concern for ourselves may afterwards impel us to get rid of
that uneasiness by endeavouring to remove the suffering which is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>cause of it. In desiring to relieve the distress of another, it is
pretended that our only wish is to remove the uneasiness it occasions
us: do we also feel this uneasiness in the first instance for the
same reason, or from regard to ourselves! It is absurd to say
that in compassionating others I am only occupied with my own
pain or uneasiness, since this very uneasiness arises from my compassion.
It is to take the effect for the cause. One half of the
process, namely, our connecting the sense of pain with the idea of it,
has evidently nothing to do with self-love: nor do I see any more
reason for ascribing the active impulse which follows to this principle,
since it does not tend to remove the idea of the object as it gives <em>me</em>
pain, or as it actually affects <em>myself</em>, but as it is supposed to affect
another. Self, mere positive self, is entirely forgotten, both practically
and consciously. The effort of the mind is not to remove the idea
or the immediate feeling of pain as an abstract impression of the
individual, but as it represents the pain which another feels, and is
connected with the idea of another’s pain. So long then as this
imaginary idea of what another feels excites my sympathy with him,
as it fixes my attention on his sufferings, however painful, as it impels
me to his relief, and to employ the necessary means for that purpose,
at the expense of my ease and satisfaction, that is, so long as I am
interested for others, it is not true that my only concern is for myself,
or that I am governed solely by the principles of self-interest.
Abstract our sympathy as it were from itself, and resolve it into
another principle, and it will no longer produce the effects which we
constantly see it produce wherever it exists. Let us suppose, for a
moment, that the sensations of others were embodied by some means
or other with our own, that we felt for them exactly as for ourselves,
would not this give us a real sympathy in them, and extend our
interest and identity beyond ourselves? Would the motives and
principles by which we are actuated be the same as before? But
the imagination, though not in the same degree, produces the same
effects: it modifies and overrules the impulses of self-love, and binds
us to the interests of others as to our own. If the imagination gives
us an artificial interest in the welfare of others, if it determines my
feelings and actions, and if it even for a moment draws them off from
the pursuit of an abstract principle of self-interest, then it cannot be
maintained that self-love and benevolence are the same. The motives
that give birth to our social affections are by means of the understanding
as much regulated by the feelings of others as if we had a
real communication and sympathy with them, and are swayed by an
impulse altogether foreign to self-love. If it should be said, that after
all we are as selfish as we can be, and that the modifications and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>restrictions of the principle of self-love are only a necessary consequence
of the nature of a thinking being, I answer, that this is the
very point I wish to establish; or that it is downright nonsense to
talk of a principle of entire selfishness in connexion with a power of
reflection, that is, with a mind capable of perceiving the consequences
of things beyond itself, and of being affected by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should any desperate metaphysician persist in affirming that my
love of others is still the love of myself, because the impression
exciting my sympathy must exist in my mind, and so be a part of
myself, I would answer that this is using words without affixing any
distinct meaning to them. The love or affection excited by any
general idea existing in my mind, can no more be said to be the love
of myself, than the idea of another person is the idea of myself,
because it is I who perceive it. This method of reasoning, however,
will not go a great way to prove the doctrine of an abstract principle
of self-interest; for, by the same rule, it would follow that in hating
another person I hate myself. Indeed, upon this principle, the whole
structure of language is a continued absurdity. It is pretended by a
violent assumption, that benevolence is only a desire to prolong the
idea of another’s pleasure in one’s own mind, because the idea exists
there: malevolence must, therefore, be a disposition to prolong the
idea of pain in one’s own mind for the same reason, that is, to injure
oneself, for by this philosophy no one can have a single idea which
does not refer to, nor any impulse which does not originate in, self.
But the love of others cannot be built on the love of self, considering
this last as the effect of ‘physical sensibility;’ and the moment we
resolve self-love into the rational pursuit of a remote object, it has
been shown that the same reasoning applies to both, and that the love
of others has the same necessary foundation in the human mind as
the love of ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have endeavoured to prove that there is no real, physical, or
essential difference between the motives by which we are naturally
impelled to the pursuit of our own welfare and that of others. The
truth of this paradox, great as it seems, may be brought to a very fair
test: namely, the being able to demonstrate that the doctrine of self-interest,
as it is commonly understood, is in the nature of things an
absolute impossibility; and, the being able to account for that hypothesis,—that
is, for the common feeling and motives of men from
habits, and a confused association of ideas aided by the use of language.
If others cannot answer my reasons, and if I can account for their
prejudices, I should not be justified in hastily relinquishing my
opinion, merely on account of its singularity. It may not be improper
briefly to recapitulate the former argument as far as it proceeded. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>am far from denying that there is a difference between real or physical
impulses and ideal motives, but I contend that this distinction is quite
beside the present purpose. For self-love properly relates to action,
and all action relates to the future, and all future objects are ideal,
and the interest we take in all such objects, and the motives to the
pursuit of them are ideal too. The distinction between self-love and
benevolence, therefore, as separate principles of action, cannot be
founded on the difference between real and imaginary objects, between
physical and rational motives, inasmuch as the motives and objects of
the one and the other are equally ideal things. Whether we voluntarily
pursue our own good or that of another, we must inevitably
pursue that which is at a distance from us, something out of ourselves,
abstracted from the being that acts and wills, and that is incompatible
always with our present sensation or physical existence. Self-love,
therefore, as the actuating principle of the mind, must imply the
efficacy and operation of the imagination of the remote ideas of things,
as connected with voluntary action, and the most refined benevolence,
the greatest sacrifices of natural affection, of sincerity, of friendship,
or humanity, can imply nothing more. The notion of the necessity
of actual objects or impressions as the motives to action could not so
easily have gained ground as an article of philosophical faith, but
from a perverse distinction of the use of the idea to abstract definitions
or external forms, having no reference to the feelings or passions;
and again from associating the word <em>imagination</em> with merely fictitious
situations and events such as never have a real existence, and which
consequently do not admit of action. If then self-love, even the most
gross and palpable, can only subsist in a rational and intellectual nature,
not circumscribed within the narrow limits of animal life, or of the
ignorant present time, but capable of giving life and interest to the
forms of its own creatures, to the unreal mockeries of future things,
to that shadow of itself which the imagination sends before; is it not
the height of absurdity to stop here, and poorly and pitifully to suppose
that this pervading power must bow down and worship this idol
of its own making, and become its blind and servile drudge, and that
it cannot extend its creatures as widely around it, as it projects them
forward, that it cannot breathe into all other forms the breath of life,
and endow even sympathy with vital warmth, and diffuse the soul of
morality through all the relations and sentiments of human life? Take
away the real, physical, mechanical principle of self-interest, and it
will have no basis to rest upon, but that which it has in common with
every principle of natural justice or humanity. That there is no real,
physical, or mechanical principle of selfishness in the mind, has been
abundantly proved. All that remains is, to show how the continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>identity of the individual with himself has given rise to the notion of
self-interest, which after what has been premised will not be a very
difficult task. What I shall attempt to show will be, that individuality
expresses not either absolute unity or real identity, but properly
such a particular relation between a number of things as produces an
immediate or continued connexion between them, and a correspondent
marked separation between them and other things. Now, in coexisting
things, one part may by means of this communication mutually act
and be acted upon by others, but where the connexion is continued,
or in successive identity of the individual, though what follows may
depend intimately on what has gone before, that is, be acted upon by
it, it cannot react upon it; that is, the identity of the individual with
itself can only relate practically to its connexion with its past, and
not with its future self.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every human being is distinguished from every other human being
both numerically and characteristically. He must be numerically
distinct by the supposition, or he would not be another individual, but
the same. There is, however, no contradiction in supposing two
individuals to possess the same absolute properties: but then these
original properties must be differently modified afterwards from the
necessary difference of their situations, unless we conceive them both to
occupy the same relative situation in two distinct systems, corresponding
exactly with each other. In fact, every one is found to differ essentially
from every one else; if not in original qualities, in the circumstances and
events of their lives, and consequently in their ideas and characters. In
thinking of a number of individuals, I conceive of them all as differing
in various ways from one another as well as from myself. They differ
in size, in complexion, in features, in the expression of their countenances,
in age, in occupation, in manners, in knowledge, in temper, in power.
It is this perception or apprehension of their real differences that first
enables me to distinguish the several individuals of the species from
each other, and that seems to give rise to the most obvious idea of
individuality, as representing, first, positive number, and, secondly, the
sum of the differences between one being and another, as they really
exist, in a greater or less degree in nature, or as they would appear to
exist to an impartial spectator, or to a perfectly intelligent mind. But
<em>I</em> am not in reality more different from others than any one individual
is from any other individual, neither do I in fact suppose myself to
differ really from them otherwise than as they differ from each other.
What is it then that makes the difference seem greater <em>to me</em>, or that
makes me feel a greater change in passing from my own idea to that
of another person, than in passing from the idea of another person to
that of any one else? Neither my existing as a separate being, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>my differing from others, is of itself sufficient to account for the idea
of self, since I might equally perceive others to exist and compare
their actual differences without ever having this idea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Farther, individuality is sometimes used to express not so much the
absolute difference or distinction between one individual and another,
as a relation or comparison of that individual with itself, whereby we
tacitly affirm that it is in some way or other the same with itself, or
one idea. Now in one sense it is true of all existences whatever that
they are literally the same with themselves; that is, they are what
they are, and not something else. Each thing is itself, is that
individual thing, and no other; and each combination of things is that
combination, and no other. So also each individual conscious being
is necessarily the same with himself; or in other words, that combination
of ideas which represents any individual person is that
combination of ideas, and not a different one. This literal and verbal
is the only true and absolute identity which can be affirmed of any
individual; which, it is plain, does not arise from a comparison of the
different parts or successive impressions composing the general idea
one with another, but each with itself or all of them taken together
with the whole. I cannot help thinking that some idea of this kind
is frequently at the bottom of the perplexity which is felt by most
people who are not metaphysicians (not to mention those who are),
when they are told that man is not always the same with himself,
their notion of identity being that he must always be what he is. He
is the same with himself, in as far as he is not another. When they
say that the man is the same being in general, they do not really mean
that he is the same at twenty that he is at sixty, but their general idea
of him includes both these extremes, and therefore the same man, that
is, the same collective idea, is both the one and the other. This
however is but a rude logic. Not well understanding the process of
distinguishing the same individual into different metaphysical sections,
to compare, collate, and set one against the other (so awkwardly do
we at first apply ourselves to the analytical art), to get rid of the
difficulty the mind produces a double individual, part real and part
imaginary, or repeats the same idea twice over; in which case it is a
contradiction to suppose that the one does not correspond exactly with
the other in all its parts. There is no other absolute identity in the
case. All individuals (or all that we name such) are aggregates, and
aggregates of dissimilar things. Here, then, the question is not how
we distinguish one individual from another, or a number of things
from a number of other things, which distinction is a matter of
absolute truth, but how we come to confound a number of things
together, and consider many things as the same, which cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>strictly true. This idea must then merely relate to such a connexion
between a number of things as determines the mind to consider
them as one whole, each part having a much nearer and more lasting
connexion with the rest than with any thing else not included in the
same collective idea. (It is obvious that the want of this close affinity
and intimate connexion between any number of things is what so
far produces a correspondent distinction and separation between one
individual and another.) The eye is not the same thing as the ear;
it is a contradiction to call it so. Yet both are parts of the same body,
which contains these and infinite other distinctions. The reason of this
is, that all the parts of the eye have evidently a distinct nature, a separate
use, a greater mutual dependence on one another than on those of the
ear; at the same time that there is a considerable connexion between the
eye and the ear, as parts of the same body and organs of the same
mind. Similarity is in general but a subordinate circumstance in
determining this relation. For the eye is certainly more like the
same organ in another individual, than the different organs of sight and
hearing are like one another in the same individual. Yet we do not,
in making up the imaginary individual, associate our ideas according
to this analogy, which would answer no more purpose than the things
themselves would, so separated and so united; but we think of them
in that order in which they are mechanically connected together in
nature, and in which alone they can serve to any practical purpose.
However, it seems hardly possible to define the different degrees or
kinds of identity in the same thing by any general rule. The nature
of the thing will best point out the sense in which it is to be the same.
Individuality may relate either to absolute unity, to the identity or
similarity of the parts of any thing, or to an extraordinary degree of
connexion between things neither the same, nor similar. This last
sense principally determines the positive use of the word, at least with
respect to man and other organized beings. Indeed, the term is
hardly ever applied in common language to other things.</p>

<p class='c007'>To insist on the first circumstance, namely, absolute unity, as
essential to individuality, would be to destroy all individuality; for it
would lead to the supposition of as many distinct individuals as there
are thoughts, feelings, actions, and properties in the same being.
Each thought would be a separate consciousness, each organ a different
system. Each thought is a distinct thing in nature; but the individual
is composed of numberless thoughts and various faculties, and contradictory
passions, and mixed habits, all curiously woven, and blended
together in the same conscious being.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to proceed to a more particular account of the origin of the
idea of self, which is the connexion of a being with itself. This can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>only be known in the first instance from reflecting on what passes in
our own minds. I should say that individuality in this sense does not
arise either from the absolute simplicity of the mind, or from its
identity with itself, or from its diversity from other minds, which are
not in the least necessary to it, but from the peculiar and intimate
connection which subsists between the several faculties and perceptions
of the same thinking being constituted as man is; so that, as the
subject of his own reflection or consciousness, the same things impressed
on any of his faculties produce a quite different effect upon him from
what they would do, if they were impressed in the same way on any
other being. The sense of personality seems then to depend entirely
on the particular consciousness which the mind has of its own operations,
sensations, or ideas. Self is nothing but the limits of the mind’s
consciousness; as far as that reaches it extends, and where that can
go no further, it ceases. The mind is one, from the confined sphere
in which it acts; or because it is not all things. It is nearer and
more present to itself than to other minds. What passes within it,
what acts upon it immediately from without, of this it cannot help
being conscious; and this consciousness is continued in it afterwards,
more or less perfectly. All that does not come within this sphere of
personal consciousness, all that has never come within it, is equally
without the verge of self; for that word relates solely to the difference
of the manner, or the different degrees of force and certainty
with which, from the imperfect and limited nature of our faculties,
certain things affect us as they act immediately upon ourselves, and
are supposed to act upon others. Hence it is evident that personality
itself cannot extend to futurity; for the whole of this idea depends
on the peculiar force and directness with which certain impulses act
upon the mind. It is by comparing the knowledge I have of my own
impressions, ideas, feelings, powers, &#38;c. with my knowledge of the
same or similar impressions, ideas, &#38;c. in others, and with this still
more imperfect conception that I form of what passes in their minds
when this is supposed to be entirely different from what passes in my
own, that I acquire the general notion of self. If I could form no
idea of any thing passing in the minds of others, or if my ideas of
their thoughts and feelings were perfect representations, <em>i.e.</em> mere conscious
repetitions of them, all personal distinction would be lost either
in pure sensation or in perfect universal sympathy. In the one case
it would be impossible for me to prefer myself to others, as I should
be the sole object of my own consciousness; and in the other case I
must love all others as myself, because I should then be nothing more
than a part of a whole, of which all others would be equally members
with myself. This distinction, however, subsists as necessarily and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>completely between myself and those who most nearly resemble me,
as between myself and those whose characters and properties are the
very opposite to mine. Indeed, the distinction itself becomes marked
and intelligible in proportion as the objects or impressions themselves
are intrinsically the same, as then it is impossible to mistake the true
principle on which it is founded, namely, the want of any direct communication
between the feelings of one being and those of another.
This will shew why the difference between ourselves and others
appears greater to us than that between other individuals, though it is
not really so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Considering mankind in this twofold relation, as they are to themselves,
or as they appear to one another, as the subjects of their own
thoughts, or the thoughts of others, we shall find the origin of that
wide and absolute distinction which the mind feels in comparing itself
with others, to be confined to two faculties, viz., sensation, or rather
consciousness, and memory. To avoid an endless subtilty of distinction,
I have not given here any account of consciousness in general;
but the same reasoning will apply to both. The operation of both
these faculties is of a perfectly exclusive and individual nature, and so
far as their operation extends (but no farther) is man a personal, or
if you will, a selfish being. The sensation excited in me by a piece
of red-hot iron striking against any part of my body is simple, absolute,
terminating as it were in itself, not representing any thing beyond itself,
nor capable of being represented by any other sensation, or communicated
to any other being. The same kind of sensation may be indeed
excited in another by the same means, but this sensation will not
imply any reference to, or consciousness of mine; there is no communication
between my nerves and another’s brain, by which he can
be affected with my sensations as I am myself. The only notice or
perception which another can have of this sensation in me, or which
I can have of a similar sensation in another, is by means of the
imagination. I can form an imaginary idea of that pain as existing
out of myself; but I can only feel it as a sensation when it is actually
impressed on myself. Any impression made on another can neither
be the cause nor object of sensation to me. Again, the impression or
idea left in my mind by this sensation, and afterwards excited either
by seeing iron in the same state, or by any other means, is properly
an idea of memory. This recollection necessarily refers to some
previous impression in my own mind, and only exists in consequence
of that impression, or of the continued connexion of the same mind
with itself: it cannot be derived from any impression made on
another. My thoughts have a particular mechanical dependence only
on my own previous thoughts or sensations. I do not remember the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>feelings of any one but myself. I may, indeed, remember the objects
which must have caused such and such feelings in others, or the outward
signs of passion which accompanied them. These, however,
are but the recollections of my own immediate impressions of what I
saw, and I can only form an idea of the feelings themselves by means
of the imagination. But, though we take away all power of imagination
from the human mind, my own feelings must leave behind them
certain traces, or representations of themselves retaining the same
general properties, and having the same intimate connexion with the
conscious principle. On the other hand, if I wish to anticipate my
own future feelings, whatever these may be, I must do so by means
of the same faculty by which I conceive of those of others, whether
past or future. I have no distinct or separate faculty on which the
events and feelings of my future being are impressed before hand, and
which shows, as in an enchanted mirror, to me, and me alone, the
reversed picture of my future life. It is absurd to suppose that the
feelings which I am to have hereafter, should excite certain correspondent
impressions of themselves before they have existed, or act
mechanically upon my mind by a secret sympathy. The romantic
sympathies of lovers, the exploded dreams of judicial astrology, the
feats of magic, do not equal the solid, substantial absurdity of this
doctrine of self-interest, which attributes to that which is not and has
not been, a mechanical operation and a reality in nature. I can only
abstract myself from this present being, and take an interest in my
future being, in the same sense and manner in which I can go out of
myself entirely, and enter into the minds and feelings of others. In
short, there neither is nor can be any principle belonging to the individual
that antecedently identifies his future events with his present
sensation, or that reflects the impression of his future feelings backwards
with the same kind of consciousness that his past feelings are
transmitted forward through the channels of memory. The size of
the river as well as its taste depends on the water that has already
fallen into it. I cannot roll back its course, nor is the stream next
the source affected by the water which falls into it afterwards, yet we
call both the same river. Such is the nature of personal identity. It
is founded on the continued connexion of cause and effect, and awaits
their gradual progress, and does not consist in a preposterous and
wilful unsettling of the natural order of things. There is an illustration
of this argument, which, however quaint or singular it may appear,
I rather choose to give than omit any thing which may serve to make
my meaning clear and intelligible. Suppose then a number of men
employed to cast a mound into the sea. As far as it has gone, the
workmen pass backwards and forwards on it: it stands firm in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>place, and though it advances further and further from the shore, it is
still joined to it. A man’s personal identity and self-interest have
just the same principle and extent, and can reach no farther than his
actual existence. But if any man of a metaphysical turn, seeing that
the pier was not yet finished, but was to be continued to a certain
point, and in a certain direction, should take it into his head to insist
that what was already built, and what was to be built were the same
pier, that the one must therefore afford as good footing as the other,
and should accordingly walk over the pier-head on the solid foundation
of his metaphysical hypothesis—he would act a great deal more
ridiculously, but would not argue a whit more absurdly than those who
found a principle of absolute self-interest on a man’s future identity
with his present being. But, say you, the comparison does not hold
in this, that a man can extend his thoughts (and that very wisely too),
beyond the present moment, whereas in the other case he cannot
move a single step forwards. Grant it. This will only show that
the mind has wings as well as feet, which is a sufficient answer to the
selfish hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the foregoing account be true (and for my part, the only
perplexity that crosses my mind in thinking of it arises from the utter
impossibility of conceiving of the contrary supposition), it will follow
that those faculties which may be said to constitute self, and the
operations of which convey that idea to the mind, draw all their
materials from the past and present. But all voluntary action, as I
have before largely shown, must relate solely and exclusively to the
future. That is, all those impressions or ideas with which selfish, or
more properly speaking, personal feelings must be naturally connected
are just those which have nothing to do at all with the motives
to action in the pursuit either of our own interest, or that of others.
If indeed it were possible for the human mind to alter the present or
the past, so as either to recal what was past, or to give it a still greater
reality, to make it exist over again, and in some more emphatical
sense, then man might, with some pretence of reason, be supposed
naturally incapable of being impelled to the pursuit of any <em>past</em> or
<em>present</em> object but from the mechanical excitement of personal motives.
It might in this case be pretended that the impulses of imagination
and sympathy are of too light, unsubstantial, and remote a creation to
influence our real conduct, and that nothing is worthy of the concern
of a wise man in which he has not this direct, unavoidable, and
homefelt interest. This is, however, too absurd a supposition to be
dwelt on for a moment. The only proper objects of voluntary action
are (by necessity) future events: these can excite no possible interest
in the mind but by the aid of the imagination; and these make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>same direct appeal to that faculty, whether they relate to ourselves or
to others, as the eye receives with equal directness the impression of
our own external form or that of others. It will be easy to perceive
by this train of reasoning how, notwithstanding the contradiction
involved in the supposition of a generally absolute self-interest, the
mind comes to feel a deep and habitual conviction of the truth of this
principle. Finding in itself a continued consciousness of its past
impressions, it is naturally enough disposed to transfer the same sort
of identity and consciousness to the whole of its being. The objects
of imagination and of the senses are, as it were, perpetually playing
into one another’s hands, and shifting characters, so that we lose our
reckoning, and do not think it worth while to mark where the one
ends and the other begins. As our actual being is constantly passing
into our future being, and carries the internal feeling of consciousness
along with it, we seem to be already identified with our future being
in this permanent part of our nature, and to feel by a mutual impulse
the same necessary sympathy with our future selves that we know we
shall have with our past selves. We take the tablets of memory,
reverse them, and stamp the image of self on that which as yet
possesses nothing but the name. It is no wonder then that the
imagination, constantly disregarding the progress of time, when its
course is marked out along the straight unbroken line of individuality,
should confound the necessary differences of things, and convert a
distant object into a present reality. The interest which is hereafter
to be felt by this continued conscious being, this indefinite unit, called
<em>me</em>, seems necessarily to affect me in every state of my existence,—‘thrills
in each nerve, and lives along the line.’ In the first place
we abstract the successive modifications of our being, and <em>particular</em>
temporary interests, into one simple nature and general principle of
self-interest, and then make use of this nominal abstraction as an
artificial medium to compel those particular actual interests into the
closest affinity and union with each other, as different lines meeting
in the same centre must have a mutual communication with each
other. On the contrary, as I always remain perfectly distinct from
others (the interest which I take in their former or present feelings
being like that which I take in their future feelings, never any thing
more than the effect of imagination and sympathy), the same illusion
and transposition of ideas cannot take place with regard to these;
namely, the confounding a physical impulse with the rational motives
to action. Indeed the uniform nature of my feelings with regard to
others (my interest in their welfare having always the same source
and sympathy) seems by analogy to confirm the supposition of a
similar simplicity in my relation to myself, and of a positive, natural,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>absolute interest in whatever belongs to that self, not confined to my
actual existence, but extending over the whole of my being. Every
sensation that I feel, or that afterwards recurs vividly to my memory
strengthens the sense of self, which increased strength in the mechanical
feeling is indirectly transferred to the general idea, and to my
remote, future, imaginary interest; whereas our sympathy with the
feelings of others being always imaginary, standing only on its own
basis, having no sensible interest to support it, no restless mechanical
impulse to urge it on, the ties by which we are bound to others hang
loose upon us: the interest we take in their welfare seems to be something
foreign to our own bosoms, to be transient, arbitrary, and directly
opposed to that necessary, unalienable interest we are supposed to
have in whatever conduces to our own well-being.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another consideration (and that probably the principal
one) to be taken into the account in explaining the origin and growth
of our selfish habits, which is perfectly consistent with the foregoing
theory, and evidently arises out of it. There is naturally, then, no
essential difference between the motives by which I am impelled to
the pursuit of my own good or that of others: but though there is
not a difference in kind, there is one in degree. We know better
what our own future feelings will be than what those of others will
be in a like case. We can apply the materials afforded us by experience
with less difficulty and more in a mass in making out the picture
of our future pleasures and pains, without frittering them away or
destroying their original sharpnesses: in a word, we can imagine
them more plainly, and must therefore be more interested in them.
This facility in passing from the recollection of my former impressions
to the anticipation of my future ones makes the transition almost
imperceptible, and gives to the latter an apparent reality and presentness
to the imagination, to a degree in which the feelings of others
can scarcely ever be brought home to us. It is chiefly from this
greater readiness and certainty with which we can look forward into
our own minds than out of us into those of other men, that that strong
and uneasy attachment to self, which often comes at last to overpower
every generous feeling, takes its rise; not, as I think I have shown,
from any natural and impenetrable hardness of the human heart, or
necessary absorption of all its thoughts and purposes in a blind exclusive
feeling of self-interest. It confirms this account, that we constantly
are found to feel for others in proportion as we know from
long acquaintance with the turn of their minds, and events of their
lives, ‘the hair-breadth scapes’ of their travelling history, or ‘some
disastrous stroke which their youth suffered,’ what the real nature of
their feelings is; and that we have in general the strongest attachment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>to our immediate relatives and friends, who from this intercommunity
of thoughts and feelings may more truly be said to be a
part of ourselves than from even the ties of blood. Moreover, a man
must be employed more usually in providing for his own wants and
his own feelings than those of others. In like manner he is employed
in providing for the immediate welfare of his family and connexions
much more than in providing for the welfare of those who are not
bound by any positive ties. And we accordingly find that the attention,
time, and pains bestowed on these several objects give him a
proportionable degree of anxiety about, and attachment to his own
interest, and that of those connected with him; but it would be
absurd to conclude that his affections are therefore circumscribed by
a natural necessity within certain impassable limits, either in the one
case or the other. It should not be forgotten here that this absurd
opinion has been very commonly referred to the effects of natural
affection as it has been called, as well as of self-interest; parental
and filial affection being supposed to be originally implanted in the
mind by the ties of nature, and to move round the centre of self-interest
in an orbit of their own, within the circle of our families and
friends. This general connexion between the habitual pursuit of any
object and our interest in it, will account for the well-known observation,
that the affection of parents to children is the strongest of all
others, frequently overpowering self-love itself. This fact does not
seem easily reconcilable to the doctrine that the social affections are
all of them ultimately to be deduced from association, or the reputed
connexion of immediate selfish gratification with the idea of some
other person. If this were strictly the case we must feel the strongest
attachment to those from whom we had received, instead of those to
whom we had done, the greatest number of kindnesses, or where the
greatest quantity of actual enjoyment had been associated with an
indifferent idea. Junius has remarked that friendship is not conciliated
by the power of conferring benefits, but by the equality with
which they are received and may be returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have hitherto purposely avoided saying any thing on the subject
of our physical appetites and the manner in which they may be
thought to affect the principle of the foregoing reasonings. They
evidently seem at first sight, to contradict the general conclusion
which I have endeavoured to establish, as they all of them tend either
exclusively or principally to the gratification of the individual, and at
the same time refer to some future or imaginary object, as the source
of this gratification. The impulse which they give to the will is
mechanical, and yet this impulse, blind as it is, constantly tends to
and coalesces with the pursuit of some rational end. That is, here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>is an end aimed at, the desire and regular pursuit of a known good,
and all this produced by motives evidently mechanical, and which
never impel the mind but in a selfish direction: it makes no difference
in the question whether the active impulse proceed directly from
the desire of positive enjoyment, or a wish to get rid of some positive
uneasiness. I should say then that, setting aside what is of a purely
physical nature in the case, the influence of appetite over our volitions
may be accounted for consistently enough with the foregoing hypothesis,
from the natural effects of a particularly irritable state of bodily
feeling, rendering the idea of that which will heighten and gratify its
susceptibility of pleasurable feeling, or remove some painful feeling,
proportionably vivid, and the object of a more vehement desire than
can be excited by the same idea, when the body is supposed to be in
a state of indifference, or only ordinary sensibility to that particular
kind of gratification. Thus the imaginary desire is sharpened by
constantly receiving supplies of pungency, from the irritation of bodily
feeling, and its direction is at the same time determined according to
the bias of this new impulse; first, indirectly by having the attention
fixed on our own immediate sensation; secondly, because that particular
gratification, the desire of which is increased by the pressure
of physical appetite, must be referred primarily and by way of distinction
to the same being, by whom the want of it is felt, that is, to
myself. As the actual uneasiness which appetite implies can only be
excited by the irritable state of my own body, so neither can the
desire of the correspondent gratification subsist in that intense degree,
which properly constitutes appetite, except when it tends to relieve
that very same uneasiness by which it was excited, as in the case of
hunger. There is in the first place the strong mechanical action of
the nervous and muscular systems co-operating with the rational desire
of my own belief, and forcing it its own way. Secondly, this state
of uneasiness grows more and more violent, the longer the relief which
it requires is withheld from it: hunger takes no denial, it hearkens to
no compromise, is soothed by no flattery, tired out by no delay. It
grows more importunate every moment, its demands become larger
the less they are attended to. The first impulse which the general
love of personal ease receives from bodily pain will give it the advantage
over my disposition to sympathise with others in the same
situation with myself, and this difference will be increasing every
moment, till the pain is removed. Thus, if I at first, either through
compassion or by an effort of the will, am regardless of my own
wants, and wholly bent upon satisfying the more pressing wants of
my companions, yet this effort will at length become too great, and I
shall be incapable of attending to any thing but the violence of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>own sensations, or the means of alleviating them. It would be easy
to show from many things that mere appetite (generally, at least, in
reasonable beings) is but the fragment of a self-moving machine, but
a sort of half organ, a subordinate instrument even in the accomplishment
of its own purposes; that it does little or nothing without the
aid of another faculty to inform and direct it. Before the impulses
of appetite can be converted into the regular pursuit of a given object,
they must first be communicated to the understanding, and modify
the will through that. Consequently, as the desire of the ultimate
gratification of the appetite is not the same with the appetite itself,
that is mere physical uneasiness, but an indirect result of its communication
to the thinking or imaginative principle, the influence of
appetite over the will must depend on the extraordinary degree of
force and vividness which it gives to the idea of a particular object;
and we accordingly find that the same cause which irritates the desire
of selfish gratification, increases our sensibility to the same desires and
gratification in others, where they are consistent with our own, and
where the violence of the physical impulse does not overpower every
other consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most interesting part of Madame De Staël’s very ingenious and
elegant work on Germany is undoubtedly (to literary readers) that in
which she has sketched with so much intelligence and grace, the
present state of opinions with respect to philosophy and taste in that
country. I have not yet seen any satisfactory abstract of her reasonings
on either of these subjects. The article in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>
touches but lightly and incidentally on them, from the variety and
pressure of other topics of a more lively and general interest. I shall
attempt to supply this deficiency, and at the same time to offer some
farther thoughts on each subject. The two points on which I wish
to enlarge are the view which Madame De Staël takes of German
poetry, as contrasted with the French, and secondly of the spirit and
principles of the German philosophy, that of Professor Kant, as
opposed to the French system of philosophy which is not indeed
peculiar to them as a nation, but common to the age. I shall begin
with the last first, not only because it is perhaps the most important,
but because I think that as the English were the first to propagate the
latter system (for the French have only adopted it from us, carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>its practical and popular application farther), we ought not to be the
last to disclaim and explode it. It may not be uninteresting as a
branch of national literature, to take a general view of the rise and
progress of their philosophy, before we come to examine Madame De
Staël’s account of the system which Kant has opposed to it, and to
shew in what that system is well-founded, and where it fails.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the prevailing system,—I mean the material or modern
philosophy, as it has been called, all thought is to be resolved into
sensation, all morality into the love of pleasure, and all action into
mechanical impulse. These three propositions taken together, embrace
almost every question relating to the human mind, and in their different
ramifications and intersections form a net, not unlike that used by the
enchanters of old, which, whosoever has once thrown over him, will
find all farther efforts vain, and his attempts to reason freely on any
subject in which his own nature is concerned, baffled and confounded
in every direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>This system, which first rose at the suggestion of Lord Bacon, on
the ruins of the school-philosophy, has been gradually growing up to
its present height ever since, from a wrong interpretation of the word
<em>experience</em>, confining it to a knowledge of things without us; whereas
it in fact includes all knowledge, relating to objects either within or out
of the mind, of which we have any direct and positive evidence. We
only know that we ourselves exist, the most certain of all truths, from
the experience of what passes within ourselves. Strictly speaking, all
other facts of which we are not immediately conscious, are such in a
secondary and subordinate sense only. Physical experience is indeed
the foundation and the test of that part of philosophy which relates to
physical objects: farther, physical analogy is the only rule by which
we can extend and apply our immediate knowledge, or infer the effects
to be produced by the different objects around us. But to say that
physical experiment is either the test, or source, or guide of that other
part of philosophy which relates to our internal perceptions, that we
are to look in external nature for the form, the substance, the colour,
the very life and being of whatever exists in our minds, or that we
can only infer the laws which regulate the phenomena of the mind
from those which regulate the phenomena of matter, is to confound
two things entirely distinct. Our knowledge of mental phenomena
from consciousness, reflection, or observation of their correspondent
signs in others is the true basis of metaphysical inquiry, as the knowledge
of <em>facts</em>, commonly so called, is the only solid basis of natural
philosophy. To assert that the operations of the mind and the operations
of matter are in reality the same, so that we should always regard the one
as symbols or exponents of the other, is to assume the very point in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>dispute, not only without any evidence, but in defiance of every appearance
to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Bacon was undoubtedly a great man, indeed one of the
greatest that have adorned this or any other country. He was a man
of a clear and active spirit, of a most fertile genius, of vast designs, of
general knowledge, and of profound wisdom. He united the powers
of imagination and understanding in a greater degree than almost any
other writer. He was one of the most remarkable instances of those
men, who, by the rare privilege of their nature, are at once poets and
philosophers, and see equally in both worlds—the individual and
sensible, and the abstracted and intelligible forms of things. The
Schoolmen and their followers attended to nothing but names, to
essences and species, to laboured analyses and artificial deductions.
They seem to have alike disregarded all kinds of experience, whether
relating to external objects, or to the observation of our own internal
feelings. From the imperfect state of knowledge, they had not a
sufficient number of facts to guide them in their experimental
researches; and intoxicated with the novelty of their vain distinctions,
learnt by rote, they were tempted to despise the clearest and most
obvious suggestions of their own minds. Subtle, restless, and self-sufficient,
they thought that truth was only made to be disputed about,
and existed no where but in their demonstrations and syllogisms.
Hence arose their ‘logomachies’—their everlasting word-fights, their
sharp debates, their captious, bootless controversies. As Lord Bacon
expresses it, ‘they were made fierce with dark keeping,’ signifying
that their angry and unintelligible contests with one another were
owing to their not having any distinct objects to engage their attention.
They built altogether on their own whims and fancies; and, buoyed
up by their specific levity, they mounted in their airy disputations in
endless flights and circles, clamouring like birds of prey, till they
equally lost sight of truth and nature. This great man, therefore,
intended an essential service to philosophy, in wishing to recall the
attention to facts and experience which had been almost entirely
neglected; and thus, by incorporating the abstract with the concrete,
and general reasoning with individual observation, to give to our conclusions
that solidity and firmness which they must otherwise always
want. He did nothing but insist on the necessity of experience, more
particularly in natural science; and from the wider field that is open to
it there, as well as the prodigious success it has met with, this latter
application of the word, in which it is tantamount to physical experiment,
has so far engrossed the whole of our attention, that mind has,
for a good while past, been in some danger of being overlaid by matter.
We run from one error into another, and as we were wrong at first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>so in altering our course, we have passed into the opposite extreme.
We despised experience altogether before: now we would have
nothing but experience, and that of the grossest kind. We have, it is
true, gained much by not consulting the suggestions of our own minds in
questions where they inform us of nothing, namely, on the particular
laws and phenomena of the material world; and we have hastily concluded
(reversing the rule) that the best way to arrive at the knowledge
of ourselves also, was to lay aside the dictates of our own consciousness,
thoughts, and feelings, as deceitful and insufficient guides,
though they are the only means by which we can obtain the least
light upon the subject. We seem to have resigned the natural use
of our understandings, and to have given up our own existence as a
nonentity. We look for our thoughts and the distinguishing properties
of our minds in some image of them in matter as we look to see our
faces in a glass. We no longer decide physical problems by logical
dilemmas, but we decide questions of logic by the evidence of the
senses. Instead of putting our reason and invention to the rack
indifferently on all questions, whether we have any previous knowledge
of them or not, we have adopted the easier method of suspending the
use of our faculties altogether, and settling tedious controversies by
means of ‘four champions fierce—hot, cold, moist and dry,’ who with
a few more of the retainers and hangers on of matter determine all
questions relating to the nature of man and the limits of the human
understanding very learnedly. But the laws by which we think, feel,
and act, we must discover in the mind itself, or not at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>This original bias in favour of mechanical reasoning and physical
analogy was confirmed by the powerful aid of Hobbes, who was,
indeed, the father of the modern philosophy. His strong mind and
body appear to have resisted all impressions, but those which were
derived from the downright blows of matter: all his ideas seemed to
lie like substances in his brain: what was not a solid, tangible,
distinct, palpable object, was to him nothing. The external image
pressed so close upon his mind that it destroyed the power of consciousness,
and left no room for attention to any thing but itself. He
was by nature a materialist. Locke assisted greatly in giving
popularity to the same scheme, as well by espousing the chief of
Hobbes’s metaphysical principles as by the doubtful resistance which
he made to the rest. And it has been perfected and has received its
last polish and roundness in the hands of some French philosophers,
as Condillac and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The modern metaphysical system assumes as its basis that the
operations of the intellect are only a continuation of the impulses
existing in matter; or that all the thoughts and conceptions of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>mind are nothing more than various modifications of the original
impressions of things on a being endued with sensation or simple
perception. This system considers ideas merely as they are caused
by outward impressions acting on the organs of sense, and excludes
the understanding as a distinct faculty or power from all share in its
own operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a summary of the general principles of this
philosophy as they are expressly laid down by Hobbes, and by the
latest writers of the French school.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That our <em>ideas</em> are copies of the impressions made by external
objects on the senses.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That as nothing exists out of the mind but matter and motion,
so it is itself with all its operations nothing but matter and motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That thoughts are single, or that we can think of only one
object at a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That we have no general nor abstract ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. That the only principle of connection between one thought and
another is association, or their previous connection in sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. That reason and understanding depend entirely on the mechanism
of language.</p>

<p class='c007'>7 and 8. That the sense of pleasure and pain is the sole spring of
action, and self-interest the source and centre of all our affections.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. That the mind acts from a mechanical or physical necessity,
over which it has no controul, and consequently is not a moral or
accountable agent.—<cite>The manner of reasoning upon this last question
is the only circumstance of importance in which Hobbes differs decidedly
from modern writers.</cite></p>

<p class='c007'>10. That there is no difference in the natural capacities of men,
the mind being originally passive to all impressions alike, and becoming
whatever it is from circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Except the first, all of these positions are either denied or doubtfully
admitted by Mr. Locke. It is, however, his admission of the
first principle, which has opened a door directly or indirectly to all
the rest. The system of Kant is a formal and elaborate antithesis to
that which bears the name of Locke, and it is built on ‘the <em>sublime</em>
restriction (as Madame de Staël expresses it) added by Leibnitz to
the well-known axiom <i><span lang="la">nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu</span></i>—<span class='fss'>NISI
INTELLECTUS IPSE</span>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in the manner of proving this restriction, and of explaining
this word, <em>the intellect</em>, that the whole question depends, and to this I
shall devote another letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle that <em>all the ideas, operations, and faculties of the mind may
be traced to, and ultimately accounted for, from simple sensation</em>, is all
that remains of Mr. Locke’s celebrated Essay, and that to which it
owes its present rank among philosophical productions. His various
attempts to modify this principle, or reconcile it to common notions
have been gradually exploded, and have given place, one by one, to
the more severe and logical deductions of Hobbes from the same
general principle. Mr. Locke took the faculties of the mind as
he found them in himself and others, and instead of levelling the
structure, was contented to place it on a new foundation. By this
compromise with prudence and candour, he prepared the way for the
introduction of the principle, which being once established, very soon
overturned all the trite opinions, and vulgar prejudices, which had
been improperly associated with it. There was in fact, no place for
them in the new system. I confess it strikes some degree of awe into
the mind, and makes it feel, that fame, even the best, is not a substantial
thing, but the uncertain shadow of real excellence, when we
reflect that the immortal renown, which attends the name of Locke
as the great luminary of the age in which he lived, is but a dim and
borrowed lustre from the writings of one, whom he himself calls, and
who has been universally considered as ‘a justly decried author.’
The sentence of the poet is as applicable here as it ever was—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor in the glistering foil</div>

      <div class='line'>But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And perfect witness of all-judging Jove!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The great defect with which the Essay on Human Understanding
is chargeable, is that there really is not a word about the understanding
in it, nor any attempt to shew what it is, or whether it is, or is not
any thing, distinct from the faculty of simple perception. The operations
of thinking, comparing, discerning, reasoning, willing, and the
like, which Mr. Locke generally ascribes to it, are the operations of
nothing, or of we know not what. All the force of his mind seems
to have been so bent on exploding innate ideas, and tracing our
thoughts to their external source, that he either forgot, or had not
leisure to examine what the internal principle of all thought is. He
took for his basis a bad simile, namely, that the mind is like a blank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>sheet of paper, originally void of all characters, and merely passive to
the impressions made upon it: for this, though true as far as relates
to innate ideas, that is, to any impressions previously existing in the
mind, is not true of the mind itself, or of the manner in which it
forms its ideas of the objects actually impressed upon it. The obvious
tendency of this simile was to convert the understanding into the
mere passive receiver and retainer of physical impressions, a convenient
repository for the straggling images of things, or a sort of empty room
into which ideas are conveyed from without through the doors of the
senses, as you would carry goods into an unfurnished lodging. And
hence, again, it has been found necessary, by subsequent writers, to
get rid of those different faculties and operations, which Mr. Locke
elsewhere supposes to belong to the mind, but which are in truth only
compatible with the active powers, and independent nature of the
mind itself. It was to remedy this deficiency that Leibnitz proposed
to add to the maxim of Locke, <em>that there is nothing in the understanding
which was not before in the senses</em>—‘that sublime restriction,’ so much
applauded by Madame de Staël—‘<span class='fss'>EXCEPT THE UNDERSTANDING ITSELF</span>:’
and it is to the establishment and development of this distinction, that
the whole of the Kantean philosophy appears to be directed. In
what manner, and in what success (judging from the representations
we have received of it) remains to be shewn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account which Madame de Staël has given of this system is
full of the graces of imagination and the charm of sentiment: it
passes slightly over many of the difficulties, and softens the abruptness
of the reasoning by the harmony of the style. It is therefore the
most popular and pleasing account which has been given of the system
of the German Philosopher: but after all, it will be better to take his
own statement, though somewhat ‘harsh and crabbed’ as the most
tangible, authentic, and satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The following,’ says his translator Willich, ‘are the elements of
his <cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite>, the first of Kant’s systematical works,
and the most remarkable for profound reasoning and the striking
illustrations, with which it throughout abounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘We are in possession of certain notions <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i><a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> which are
absolutely independent of all experience, although the objects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>experience correspond with them, and which are distinguished by
necessity, and strict universality. To these are opposed empirical
notions, or such as are only possible <i><span lang="fr">à posteriori</span></i>, that is, through
experience. Besides these, we have certain notions, with which no
objects of experience ever correspond, which rise above the world of
sense, and which we consider as the most sublime, such as God,
liberty, immortality. There is always supposed in every empirical
notion, or impression of external objects, a pure perception <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i>,
a form of the sensitive faculty, <em>viz.</em> space and time. This form first
renders every actual appearance of objects possible. By the sensitive
faculty we are able to form perceptions; by the understanding we
form general ideas. By the sensitive faculty we experience impressions,
and objects are given to us; by the understanding we bring representations
of these objects before us: we think of them. Perceptions and
general ideas are the elements of all our knowledge. Without the
sensitive faculty, no object could be given (proposed to) us; without
the understanding none would be thought of by us. These two powers
are really distinct from one another; but neither of the two without
the other can produce a <em>notion</em>. In order to obtain a distinct notion
of any one thing, we must present to our general ideas objects in
perception, and reduce our perceptions to, or connect them with,
these general ideas. As the sensitive faculty has its determined
forms, so has our understanding likewise forms <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i>. These may
be properly termed <em>categories</em>; they are pure ideas of the understanding,
which relate, <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, to the objects of perception in
general. The objects of experience, therefore, are in no other way
possible; they can in no other way be thought of by us, and their
multiplied diversity can only be reduced to one act of judgment, or
to one act of consciousness, by means of these categories of sense.
Hence, the categories have objective reality. They are either
categories of</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Quantity</em>, as unity, number, totality; or,</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Of <em>Quality</em>, as reality, negation, limitation; or,</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Of <em>Relation</em>, as substance and accident, cause and effect; or,</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Of <em>Modality</em>, as possibility and impossibility, existence and
non-existence, necessity and contingency.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The judgment is the capacity of applying the general ideas of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>understanding to the information of experience. The objects of
experience are regulated according to these ideas; and not, <i><span lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>,
our ideas according to the objects.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the outline of this author’s account of the intellect, which,
after all, appears to be rather dogmatical than demonstrative. He is
much more intent on raising an extensive and magnificent fabric, than
on laying the foundations. Each part does not rest upon its own
separate basis, but, like the workmanship of some lofty arch, is
supported and rivetted to its place by the weight and regular balance
of the whole. Kant does not appear to trouble himself about the
evidence of any particular proposition, but to rely on the conformity
and mutual correspondence of the different parts of his general
system, and its sufficiency, if admitted, to explain all the phenomena
of the human intellect with consistency and accuracy;—in the same
manner as the decypherer infers that he has found the true key of the
hieroglyphic hand-writing, when he is able to solve every difficulty
by it. However profound and comprehensive we may allow the
views of human nature unfolded by this philosopher to be, his method
is necessarily defective in simplicity, clearness, and force. His
reasoning is seldom any thing more than a detailed, paraphrased
explanation of his original statement, instead of being (what it ought
to be) an appeal to known facts, or a deduction from acknowledged
principles, or a detection of the inconsistencies of other writers.
The extreme involution and technicality of his style proceed from
the same source; that is, from the necessity of adapting a conventional
language to the artificial and arbitrary arrangement of his ideas.
The whole of Kant’s system is evidently an elaborate antithesis or
contradiction to the modern philosophy, and yet it is by no means a
real approximation to popular opinion. Its chief object is to oppose
certain fundamental principles to the <em>empirical</em> or mechanical philosophy,
and it either rejects or explains away the more common and
established notions, except so far as they coincide with the rigid theory
of the author. He sets out with a preconceived hypothesis; and all
other facts and opinions are made to bend to a predominant purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The founder of the <em>transcendental</em> philosophy very properly insists
on the distinction between the sensitive and the intellectual faculties,
and makes this division the ground-work of his entire system. He
considers the joint operation of these different powers as necessary to
all our knowledge, and enumerates with scrupulous formality the
different ideas which originate in this complex progress, and points
out the share which each has in each. The author conceives of
certain general ideas, as <em>substance</em> and <em>accident</em>, <em>cause</em> and <em>effect</em>,
<em>totality</em>, <em>number</em>, <em>quantity</em>, <em>relation</em>, <em>possibility</em>, <em>necessity</em>, etc. as pure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>ideas of the understanding; and he classes <em>space</em> and <em>time</em> as primary
forms of the sensitive faculty.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a> All this may be very true; but the
proof may also be required, and it is not given. Yet modern metaphysicians
are not likely, either as sceptical inquirers after truth, or
as lovers of abstruse paradoxes, to be satisfied with the bare
assumption of a common prejudice. They will say, either that all
these ideas have no real existence in the mind, that they are mere
abstract terms which owe their force and validity to the mechanism
of language; or admitting their existence in the mind, they will
contend with Locke, that they are only general, reflex, and compound
ideas, originally derived from sensation. ‘Whence do all the
ideas and operations of the mind proceed?’ <em>From experience</em>, is the
answer given by the modern philosophy—<cite>From experience and from
the understanding</cite>, is the answer given by Kant. The former solution
has the advantage of simplicity; and the logical proof is wanting to
the latter. To compare grave things with gay, the display which
this celebrated philosopher makes of his categories, his forms of the
sensitive faculty, his pure ideas, and <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i> principles, somewhat
resembles the method taken by Sir Epicure Mammon in <cite>The
Alchymist</cite> to persuade his sceptical friend that he is about to discover
the philosopher’s stone by overpowering his imagination with the
description of the fine things he will do when he has it:—‘And all
this I will do with the stone.’ ‘But will all this give you the
stone?’ says Pertinax Surly, who ‘will not believe antiquity’ any
more than our modern sceptics.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think that the truth may be got at much more simply, and
without all this parade of words. The business of the mind is
twofold—to receive impressions and to perceive their relations;
without which there can be no ideas. Now the first of these is the
office of the senses, and is the only original function of the mind,
according to the prevailing system. The second is properly the
office of the understanding, and is that, the nature or existence of
which is the great point in debate between the contending parties.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>The more complex and refined operations of this faculty, such as
judging, reasoning, abstraction, willing, etc. are either totally denied,
or at best resolved into simple ideas of sensation by modern metaphysical
writers. I know of no better way, therefore, to establish
the contrary hypothesis than to take these simple ideas of the
moderns, and shew that they contain the same necessary principles of
the understanding, the same operations of judging, comparing, distinguishing,
abstracting, which they discard with so much profound
contempt, or treat as accidental and artificial results of some higher
faculty. If it can be proved that the understanding, in the strict and
exclusive sense, is necessary to our having any <em>ideas</em> whatever,—that
the very terms are synonymous and inseparable—that in the first
original conception of the simplest object of nature there is implied
the same principle, a power of perceiving the relations of different
things, which is only exerted in a more perfect and comprehensive
manner in the most complex and difficult processes of the human
intellect, one would think that there must be an end of the question.</p>

<p class='c019'>‘For men to have recourse to subtleties in raising difficulties, and then to
complain that they should be taken off by minutely examining these subtleties, is
a strange kind of proceeding.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot better explain the modern theory of the understanding
(which it will be the object of this letter to consider) than in the
words of one of the best and ablest commentators of that school,
Mr. Horne Tooke.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The business of the mind,’ he says ‘appears to me to be very
simple. It extends no farther than to receive impressions, that is,
to have sensations or feelings. What are called its operations are
merely the operations of language. The greatest part of Mr. Locke’s
Essay, that is, all which relates to what he calls <em>the composition</em>,
<em>abstraction</em>, <em>complexity</em>, <em>generalization</em>, <em>relation</em>, etc. of ideas, does
indeed merely concern language. If he had been sooner aware of the
inseparable connection between words and knowledge, he would not
have talked of the composition of ideas, but would have seen that the
only composition was in the terms, and consequently, that it was as
improper to talk of a complex idea as of a complex star! I will
venture to say that it is an easy matter, upon Mr. Locke’s own
principles and a physical consideration of the senses and the mind, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>prove the impossibility of the composition of ideas, and that they are
not ideas, but merely terms, which are general and abstract.’—Diversions
of Purley, Vol. i. p. 39, 51, &#38;c.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Now this is very explicit, and, I also conceive, very logical. For
I am ready to grant that ‘Mr. Locke’s own principles and a physical
consideration of the mind’ do lead to the conclusions here stated;
and it is on that account that I shall attempt to shew that those
principles and the consideration of the mind, as a physical thing, are
in themselves absurd. These writers taking up the principle, that to
have sensations or feelings was the only real faculty of the mind, and
perceiving that the having sensations merely was a different thing from
having an idea or consciousness of their relations (inasmuch as no
sensation as such can include a knowledge of or reference to any
other) have inferred very rationally that all the operations of the mind
founded on a principle of general consciousness or common understanding,
<em>viz.</em> <em>compounding</em>, <em>comparing</em>, <em>discerning</em>, <em>judging</em>, <em>reasoning</em>, etc.
were excluded from their physical theory of sensation, and must be
referred to some trick or deception of the mind, the mechanism of
language or habitual association of ideas. According to this theory,
besides the sensible impressions of individual objects, and their distinct
traces left in the memory—the rest is merely words. In supposing
that we combine these different impressions together, that we compare
different objects, that we reason upon them, it seems we only deceive
ourselves, and mistake a rapid and mechanical transition from one idea
to another for the actual perception of the relations between them.
Thus have these philosophers sacrificed all the known facts and
conscious operations of the mind to a literal deduction from a gross
verbal fallacy. For what are these single objects or individual ideas,
of which the senses are competent to take cognizance, and beyond
which the understanding can never advance a step? Neither more
nor less than complex and general ideas, which imply all the same
intellectual impossibilities of comparing, judging, distinguishing, &#38;c.
<em>i.e.</em> of perceiving a number of diversified relations, of connecting the
<span class='fss'>MANY</span> into the <span class='fss'>ONE</span>, which are objected to the more deliberate and
formal acts of understanding and reason. The mind, say they, can
perceive but one idea at a time, that is, it may perceive a square or
a triangle, but it cannot compare them together, or perceive their
proportions, because to do this, it must attend to different ideas at
once. Yet what is this individual idea of a square, for instance, but
an idea of given lines, their direction, equality, connection, &#38;c. all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>which must be combined together in the mind, before it can possibly
form any idea of the object? Mr. Tooke says, the complexity is in
the term. I should say, the individuality is in the term, that is, in
the application of one name to a collective idea, which superficial
reasoners, at once the slaves of idle paradox and vulgar prejudice,
have therefore imagined to be one thing. The whole error of this
system has, indeed, arisen from considering ideas themselves, or those
particular objects, which are marked by a single name, or strike at
once, and in a mass, upon the senses, as simple things. But there is
no one of these particular ideas, as they are called, which is not an
aggregate of many things, or that can subsist for a moment but in the
understanding. By destroying the composition of ideas, all ideas as
well as all combinations of ideas, would be completely and for ever
banished from the mind; which would be left a mere <i><span lang="la">tabula rasa</span></i>, a
blank, indeed, or would at all times strictly resemble what Mr. Locke
describes it to be in its original state, ‘a dark closet with a little
glimmering of light let in through the loop-holes of the senses.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Writers, in general, who have maintained the existence of a
distinct faculty besides the senses, have applied themselves to shew
that, besides particular ideas or objects, it was necessary to admit the
understanding to explain the perception of the relations between them.
My purpose is to shew that the same perception of relation, the same
understanding is implied in the very ideas or objects themselves. To
have sensations is not to compare them, that is, sensation and understanding
are not the same thing. To have ideas, it is necessary to
compare our sensations, that is, ideas and understanding are the same
thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>I can conceive then of a being endued with the power of sensation,
so as to receive the direct impressions of outward objects, and also
with memory, so as to retain them for any length of time, as they
were severally and unconnectedly presented, yet without any signs of
understanding. The state of such a being would be that of animal
life, and something more (with the addition of memory), but it would
not amount to intellect. As this distinction is rather difficult to be
explained, I hope I may be allowed to express it in any way I can,
and without sacrificing to the graces. Suppose a number of animalculæ,
as a heap of mites in a rotten cheese, lying as close together as
they possibly can (though the example should be of something more
‘drossy and divisible’ of something less reasonable, approaching
nearer to pure sensation than we can conceive of any creature that
exercises the functions of the meanest instinct). No one will contend
that in this heap of living matter there is any idea or intimation of the
number, position, or intricate involutions of that little, lively, restless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>tribe. This idea is evidently not contained in any of the parts
separately, nor is it contained in all of them put together. That is,
the aggregate of many actual sensations is, we here plainly see, a
totally different thing from the collective idea, comprehension or consciousness
of those sensations, as connected together into one whole,
or of any of their relations to each other. We may go on multiplying
sensations to the end of time, without ever advancing one step in the
other process, or producing a single thought. But in what, I would
ask, does this supposition differ from that of many distinct particles of
matter, full of animation, tumbling about, and pressing against each
other, in the same brain, except that we make use of this brain as a
common medium to unite their different desultory actions in the same
general principle of thought or consciousness—that is, understanding?
Or, if this comparison should be thought not courtly enough, let us
imagine one of Mrs. Salmon’s full faced, comely wax figures, sitting
in its chair of state, to be suddenly endued with life and physical
organization but nothing more. Such an unaccountable <i><span lang="la">lusus naturæ</span></i>
would answer exactly to the theory of modern metaphysicians, or
would be capable of receiving feelings or impressions by its different
organs, but would be totally void of any reflection upon them. It
would be only a bloated mass of listless sensation, a sordid compound
of proud flesh and irritable humours, a mere animal existence, a living
automation, crawling all over with morbid feelings, but without the
least ray of understanding, or any knowledge of itself or of the things
around, incapable of consistency of character or purpose, of foresight,
deliberation, sympathy, and of all that distinguishes human reason or
dignifies human nature!</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides actual, sensible impressions, I suppose that there is a
common principle of thought, a superintending faculty, which alone
perceives the relations of things and enables us to comprehend their
connections, forms, and masses. This faculty is properly the understanding,
and it is by means of this faculty that man indeed becomes
a reasonable soul. Without this surrounding and forming power, we
could never conceive the idea of any one object, as of a table or a
chair, a blade of grass or a grain of sand. Every one of these includes
a certain configuration, hardness, colour, size, &#38;c. <em>i.e.</em> impressions of
different things, received by different senses, which must be put
together by the understanding before they can be referred to any
particular object, or considered as one idea. Without this faculty, all
our ideas would be necessarily decomposed, and crumbled down into
their original elements and fluxional parts. We could assuredly in
this case never connect the different links in a chain of reasoning
together, for the very links of which this chain must consist would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>ground to powder. We could neither form any comparison between
our ideas, nor have any ideas to compare. There would be an infinite
divisibility in the impressions of the mind, as well as in the parts of
material objects. Each separate impression must remain absolutely
simple and distinct, unknown to and unconscious of the rest, shut up
in the narrow cell of its own individuality. No two of these atomic
impressions could ever club together to form even a sensible point,
much less should we be able to arrive at any of the larger masses or
nominal descriptions of things. The most that sensation could possibly
do for us would be to furnish the mind with ideas of some of those
which Mr. Locke calls the simple qualities of objects, as of colour or
pressure, though not as a general notion or diffused feeling, for it is
certain that no one impression could ever contain more than the tinge
of a single ray of light, or the puncture of a single particle of matter.
Perhaps we might in this way be supposed to possess an infinite
number of microscopic impressions and fractions of ideas, but there
being nothing to arrange or bind them together, the whole would
present only a disjointed mass of blind, unconscious confusion. All
nature, all objects, all parts of all objects, would be equally ‘without
form and void.’ <em>The mind alone is formative</em>, to use the expression of
Kant; or it is that which by its pervading and elastic energy unfolds
and expands our ideas, that gives order and consistency to them, that
assigns to every part its proper place, and fixes it there, and that
frames the idea of the whole. Or in other words, it is the understanding
alone that perceives relation, but every object is made up of
a bundle of relations. In short, there is no object or idea which
does not consist of a number of parts arranged in a certain manner,
but of this arrangement the parts themselves cannot be sensible. To
make each part conscious of its relation to all the rest is to suppose an
infinite number of intellects instead of one; and to say that a knowledge
or perception of each part separately <em>without</em> a reference to the
rest can produce a conception of the whole, is a contradiction in
terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ideas then are the offspring of the understanding, not of the senses.
An idea necessarily implies, not only a number of distinct positive
impressions, but some bond of union between them, some internal
conscious principle to which they are alike communicated, and which
grasps, overlooks, and comprehends the whole. The idea of a square,
for example, is not the same thing with the compound impression
made by the figure on the senses. For the immediate impression of
any one of the sides cannot, as a mere sensation, be accompanied
with an additional knowledge or reflex image of the remaining three
sides, but is a perfectly distinct, physical thing; neither can the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>actual coexistence of all these impressions be accompanied with a
consciousness of their mutual relations to each other, <em>i.e.</em> with an idea
of the whole, without supposing some general representative faculty,
to which these distinct impressions are referred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Otherwise, different impressions made on the same organized or
sentient being would no more produce the slightest continuity of
thought or idea of the same object than different physical impressions
conveyed to different organized beings would produce an immediate
consciousness of these different objects or of the relations between
them. If to have sensations were the same thing as to compare them,
then different persons seeing different objects might without any
communication make an exact comparison between them. If to have
the sensible impression of the different parts of an object were the
same thing as to form an idea of it, then different persons looking at
the two halves of any object would be able to compound an idea of
the whole between them, though each of them was perfectly
unconscious of what was passing in the other’s mind. Unless we
suppose some faculty of this sort which opens a direct communication
between our perceptions, so that the same thinking principle is at the
same time cognisant of different impressions, and of their relations to
each other, it seems a thing impossible to conceive how any comparison
can take place between different impressions existing at the
same time, or between our past and present impressions, or ever to
explain what is meant by saying, ‘<em>I</em> perceive such and such objects,
<em>I</em> remember such and such events,’ since these different impressions
are evidently referred to the same conscious being, which very idea
of individuality could never have been so much as conceived of, if
there were no other connection between our perceptions, than that
which arises from the juxtaposition of the particles of matter on
which they are actually impressed, or from ‘a physical consideration
of the senses and the mind.’ The mind in this case consisting of
nothing more than a succession of material points, each part would
be sensible of the corresponding part of any object which might be
impressed upon it, but could certainly know nothing of the impression
which was made on any other part of the same organic substance,
except by its communication to the same general principle of understanding.
Ideas would exist in the mind, like tapestry figures or
pictures in a gallery, without a spectator. On this hypothesis, I
perfectly agree with Mr. Horne Tooke, that it would be as absurd
to talk of a complex idea as of a complex star; for each impression
or sensation must be as perfectly distinct from, and unconnected with
the rest, as the stars that compose a constellation. One idea or
impression would have no more connection with any other, than if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>were parcel of another intellect, or floated in the region of the
moon.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is strange that Mr. Locke should rank among simple ideas that
of number, which he defines to be the idea of unity repeated. But
how the impression of successive or distinct units should ever give
the idea of repetition, unless the former instances are borne in mind,
I have not the slightest conception. There might be an endless
transition from one unit to another, but no addition made or ideal
aggregate formed. As well might we suppose, that a body of an
inch diameter, by shifting from place to place, may enlarge its
dimensions to a foot or a mile, as that a succession of units, perceived
separately, should produce the complex idea of multitude. On the
mechanical hypothesis, the mind can receive or attend to but one
impression at a time, and the idea of number would be too mighty
for it. Though Mr. Locke constantly supposes the mind to perceive
relations, and explains its common operations on this principle, there
is but one place in his work in which he seems to have been upon
the point of discovering that this principle lies at the foundation of,
and is absolutely necessary to all our ideas whatever. He says, in
the beginning of his chapter on Power, which he classes among
simple ideas, ‘I confess power includes in it <em>some kind of relation</em>
(a relation to action or change), as, indeed, which of our ideas, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>what kind soever, when attentively considered, does not? For our ideas
of extension, duration, and number, do they not all contain in them
a secret relation of the parts? Figure and motion have something
relative in them much more visibly; and sensible qualities, as colours
and smells, what are they but the powers of different bodies in
relation to our perception? And if considered in the things themselves,
do they not depend on the bulk, figure, texture, and motion
of the parts? All which include some kind of relation in them.
Our idea, therefore, of power, I think, may well have a place
amongst other simple ideas, and be considered as one of them, being
one of those that make a principal ingredient in our complex ideas of
substances.’—Essay on Human Understanding, vol. i. p. 234.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is to say, in other words, the idea of power, though
confessedly complex, according to Mr. Locke, as depending on
the changes we observe produced by one thing on another, is to
pass for a simple idea, because it has as good a right to this denomination
as other complex ideas, which are usually classed as simple ones.
It is thus that the inquiring mind seems to be always hovering on the
brink of truth: but timidity, or indolence, or prejudice, makes us
shrink back, unwilling to trust ourselves to the fathomless abyss.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have thus given the best account which it is in my power to
give of the understanding, as that conscious, comprehensive principle,
which is the source not only of judgment and reasoning, but which
is implied in every possible idea of the mind, or conception even of
sensible objects. Every such object, it has been shewn, is made up
of a number of individual impressions, yet how these perfectly
detached, and desultory impressions should of themselves contain

order, number, likeness, distances, limits, &#38;c. by which alone they
can be connected into one whole—without being first communicated
to the same conscious principle of thought, to one diffusive, and yet
self-centered intellect, one undivided active spirit, co-extended with
the object, and yet ever present to itself, that</p>

<p class='c007'>I am aware that the long digression on the formation of our ideas,
with which I troubled you in my last, will be looked upon as rhapsody
and extravagance by the strictest sect of those who are called philosophers.
The understanding has been set aside by these ingenious
persons as an awkward incumbrance, since they conceived it practicable
to carry on the whole business of thought and reason by a
succession of individual images and sensible points. The fine network
of the mind, the intellectual cords that bind and hold our scattered
perceptions together, and form the living line of communication
between them, are dissolved and vanish before the clear light of
modern metaphysics, as the gossamer is dissipated by the sun. The
adepts in this system smile at the contradictions involved in the
supposition of perceiving the relations between different things, and
say that the common theory of the understanding leads to the
absurdity that the mind may attend to two ideas at once, which is
with them impossible. What I have endeavoured to establish, is,
that if the mind cannot have more than one idea at a time, it can
never have any, since all the ideas we know of consist of more than
one; and though the conviction we have of attending to different
impressions at once, when we compare, distinguish, judge, reason, &#38;c.
has been gratuitously resolved into a deception of the mind, mistaking
a rapid succession of objects for a joint conception of them, yet it
will hardly be pretended that we deceive ourselves in thinking we
have any ideas at all. Whether the advocates for this hypothesis
will sit down contented under the total dissipation of all thought, the
utter privation of all ideas, to which, by their own arguments, they
will have reduced themselves, it remains for them to determine. We
have seen that Mr. Tooke resolves the complexity of our ideas into
the complexity of the terms made use of. How a term can be
complex, otherwise than from the complexity of its meaning, that
is, of the idea attached to it, is by no means easy to understand.
Other writers, to avoid the seeming contradiction of supposing the
mind to divide its attention between different objects, have suggested
the instant of its passing from one to the other as the true point of
comparison between them; or that the time when it had the idea of
both together, was the time when it had an idea of neither. To
such absurdities are ingenious men driven by setting up argument
against fact, and denying the most obvious truths for which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>cannot account, like the sophist who denied the existence of motion,
because he could not understand its nature. It might perhaps be
deemed a sufficient answer to those who build systems and lay down
learned propositions on the principle that the mind can comprehend
but one idea at a time, to say that they consequently can have no
meaning in what they write, since when they begin a sentence, they
cannot have the least idea what will be the end of it, and by the time
they get there, must totally forget the beginning.—‘Peace to all
such.’<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Horne Tooke justly complains of the uncertainty, confusion,
and laxity of Mr. Locke’s reasoning on the subject of abstract ideas,
though I cannot agree with him that it is therefore ‘very different from
that incomparable author’s usual method of proceeding.’—See Essay
on Human Understanding, vol. ii. p. 15, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am quite at a loss to determine, from Mr. Locke’s various
statements, whether he really supposed the abstraction to be in the
ideas, or merely in the terms. There is none of this wavering and
perplexity in the minds of his French commentators, none of this
suspicion of error, and anxious desire to correct it; no unforeseen
objections arise to stagger their natural confidence in themselves; it
is all the same light, airy, self-complacency, not a speck is seen to
sully the clear sky of their philosophy, not a wrinkle disturbs the
smooth and smiling current of their thoughts. In the Logic of the
Abbé Condillac, that manual of the modern sciolist, the question of
abstract ideas is settled and cleared from all difficulties, past, present,
and to come, with as little expence of thought, time, and trouble, as
possible. The Abbé demonstrates with ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But what in truth,’ he asks, ‘is the reality which a general and
abstract idea has in the mind? It is nothing but a name; or if it is
any thing more, it necessarily ceases to be abstract and general. If
in thinking of <em>a man</em> in general I contemplate anything in this word,
besides the mere denomination, it can only be by representing to
myself some one man; and a man can no more be a man in the
abstract in my mind than in nature. Abstract ideas are therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>only denominations. This confirms what we have already demonstrated,
how necessary words are to us; for if we had no general
terms, we should have no abstract ideas; if we had no abstract ideas,
we should have neither <em>genera</em> nor <em>species</em>; and without <em>genera</em> and
<em>species</em>, we could reason upon nothing. To speak, to reason, to form
general and abstract ideas, are then in fact the same thing; and this
truth, simple as it is, might pass for a discovery. Certainly, men in
general have not even had a notion of it.’—Logic, p. 136.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, in order to prevent these <em>genera</em> and <em>species</em>, and all rational
ideas along with them, from being precipitated into the empty abyss
of words prepared for them by these philosophers, it may be proper
to ask one question, viz. if we have no idea of <em>genera</em> and <em>species</em>, or
of what different things have in common or alike, that is, if the idea is
nothing but the name, how is it that we know when to apply the
same general name to different particulars, which on this principle
can have nothing left to connect them in the mind? For example,
take the words, <em>a white horse</em>. Now, say they, it is the terms which
are general or common, but we have no general or abstract idea
corresponding to them. But if we have no general idea of <em>white</em>,
nor any general idea of <em>a horse</em>, what have we left to guide us in
applying the phrase to any but the first horse, any more than in
applying the terms of an unknown tongue to their respective objects?
In short, what is it that ‘puts the same common name into a capacity
of signifying many particulars,’ but that common nature or kind which
is conceived to belong to them? Condillac says, that without
general terms, there would be no general ideas; it appears to me,
that without general ideas there could be no general terms. Language
without this would be reduced to a heap of proper names, and we
should be as completely at a loss to class any object generally from
its agreement with others, or to say at sight, this is a man, this is a
horse, as to know whether we should call the first man we accidentally
met in the street by the name of John or Thomas. The very
existence of language is alone a sufficient proof of the power of
abstraction in the human mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is so far from being true, according to the modern philosophy,
that we have neither complex nor general ideas, that, I think, it may
be proved to a demonstration that we have and can have no others.
I must premise, however, that I do not believe it possible ever to
arrive at general or abstract ideas by beginning in Mr. Locke’s
method with particular images. This faculty of abstraction is by
most writers considered as a sort of artificial refinement upon our
other ideas, as an excrescence no ways contained in the common
impressions of things, nor necessary to the common purposes of life;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and is by Mr. Locke altogether denied to be among the faculties of
brutes. It is described as the ornament and top-addition of the mind
of man, which proceeding from simple sensations upwards is gradually
sublimed into the abstract notions of things:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in32'>‘So from the root</div>
      <div class='line'>Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves</div>
      <div class='line'>More airy, last the bright consummate flower.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>On the contrary, I conceive that all our notions, from first to last,
are (strictly speaking) general and abstract, not absolute or particular;
and that to have a perfectly distinct idea of any one individual object or
concrete existence, either as to the parts of which it is composed, or
the differences belonging to it, or the circumstances connected with
it, would require an unlimited power of comprehension in the human
mind, which is impossible. All particular things consist of, and even
lead to, an infinite number of other things. Abstraction is therefore a
necessary consequence of the limitation of the comprehensive faculty,
and mixes itself, more or less, with every act of the understanding,
of whatever kind, during every moment of its existence. The same
fallacy has led to the rejection of abstract and general ideas which
has led to the rejection of complex ones, viz. that of supposing
sensible images to be perfectly simple or individual things. But the
truth is, that there is no one idea of an individual object which is
any thing more than a general and imperfect notion of it: for as
there is no such idea which does not relate to a number of complicated
impressions and their connections, so we can conceive the
whole of no one object. Again, there is no idea of a particular
quality of any object, which is perfectly simple and definite, but the
result of a number of sensible impressions of the same sort, classed
together by the mind under the abstract notion of likeness, or of something
common between them, without attending to their difference in
other respects.</p>

<p class='c007'>This view of the subject is not, I confess, very obvious at first
sight, and requires strong and clear proof, but it also admits of it.
The only way to defend our common sense against the sophisms of
the moderns is to retort their own analytical distinctions upon
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In looking at any object, as at St. James’s Palace, for example, it
is taken for granted that the impression I have of it is a perfectly
distinct, precise, and definite idea, in which abstraction or generalisation
has no concern. Now it appears to me an easy matter to shew
that this sensible image of a particular building is itself but a vague
and confused notion, not one precise, individual impression, or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>number of impressions, distinctly perceived. For I would demand
of any one who thinks his senses furnish him with these infallible and
perfect images of things, free from all contradiction and perplexity,
what is the amount of the knowledge which he has of the object
before him? For instance, is the knowledge which he has that St.
James’s Palace is larger than the houses which are near it, owing to
his perceiving, with a glance of the eye, all the bricks of which the
front is composed, or can he not tell that it contains a number of
windows of different sizes, without distinctly counting them? Let
us even suppose that he has this exact knowledge, yet this will not
be enough unless he has also a distinct perception of the number and
size of the panes of glass in each window, and of every mark, stain,
or dent in each brick, otherwise, his idea of each of these particulars
will still be general, and his most substantial knowledge built on
shadows, that is, composed of a number of parts, of the parts of which
he has no knowledge. In the same manner that I form an idea of
St. James’s Palace, I can form an idea of Pall-Mall, of the adjoining
streets, of Westminster, and London, of Paris, of France, and
England, and of the different cities and kingdoms of the world. At
least, I do not see the point of separation in this progressive scale of
our ideas. May I not be able, in looking out of my window, to
distinguish, first, a certain object in the distance, then that it is a
man, then that it is a person whom I know, and all this before I can
distinguish his particular features; and after I can distinguish those
features, what do I know or see of them, except their general
form, expression, and effect? Little or nothing. Let any one, who
is not an artist, or let any one who is, attempt to give an outline from
memory of the features of his most intimate friend, and he will feel
the truth of this remark. Yet though he does not know the exact
turn of any one feature, he will instantly, and without fail, recognise
the person the moment he meets him in the street, and that often,
merely from catching a glimpse of some part of his dress, or from
peculiarity of motion, though he may be quite at a loss to define in
what this peculiarity consists, or to account for its impression on him.
We may be said to have a particular knowledge of things, in proportion
to the number of parts which we distinguish in them. But the
real ultimate foundation of all our knowledge is and must be general,
that is, made up of masses, not of points, a mere confused result of a
number of impressions, not analysed by the mind, since there is no
object which does not consist of an infinite number of parts, and we
have not an infinite number of distinct ideas, answering to them.
The knowledge of every finite being rests in generals, and if we think
to exclude all generality from our ideas of things, as implying a want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>of perfect truth and clearness, it will be impossible for the mind to
form an idea of any one object whatever. Let any person try the
experiment of counting a flock of sheep driven fast by him, and he
will soon find his imagination unable to keep pace with the rapid
succession of objects, and his idea of a positive number slide into the
general notion of multitude. But because there are more objects
passing before him than he can possibly count, he will not, therefore,
think that there are none, nor will the word, <em>flock</em>, present to his
mind a mere name without any idea corresponding to it. Every act
of the attention, every object we see or think of, offers a proof of
the same kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>These remarks will be found to contain the answer to the common
argument used on this subject, that in thinking of a man in general,
we must always conceive of a man of a particular size and figure.
Now if it be meant that when we pronounce the word <em>man</em>, we have
either no idea at all, or a distinct and perfect one of an entire figure
of a man with all its parts and proportions, it would amount to a
knowledge, which no sculptor or painter ever had of any one figure
of which he was the most thorough master, and which he had
immediately before him. Or if it be only meant that we think of a
particular height, which must be a precise, positive, determinate
idea, even this supposition may in the same way be shewn to be
exceedingly fallacious, and an inversion of the natural order of our
ideas. For take any given height of a man, whether tall, short, or
middle-sized, and let that height be as visible as you please, yet the
actual height to which it amounts must be made up of the length of
the different parts, the head, the face, the neck, the body, limbs, &#38;c.
all which must be distinctly added together by the mind, before the
sum total which they compose can be pretended to be a precise,
definite, individual idea. In the impression then of a given visible
object, we have only a general idea of something more or less
extended, and never of the precise length itself, for this precise
length (as it is thought to be) is necessarily composed of a number of
subordinate lengths, too many and too minute to be separately attended
to, or jointly conceived by the mind, and at last loses itself in the
infinite divisibility of matter. What sort of absolute certainty can
therefore be found in any such image or ideas, I cannot well conceive:
it seems to me like seeking for distinctness in the dancing of
insects in the evening sun, or for fixedness and rest in the motion of
the sea. All particulars are nothing but generals, more or less defined
according to circumstances, but never perfectly so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, as the ideas of sensible objects can only be general notions,
so the ideas of sensible qualities are properly abstract ideas of likeness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>or of something common between a number of sensible impressions of
the same class or sort. For example, the idea I have of the whiteness
of a marble statue is not the idea of a point, nor of any number
of points, with all their differences and circumstances, but a relative
idea of the colour of the whole statue. Now in arriving at this
general result, or in classing its sensible impressions together as of the
same sort or quality, the mind certainly is not conscious of every stain
in the colour of the marble, or streak that may happen to vary it, or
of its shape or size, or of every difference of light and shade, arising
from inequality of surface, &#38;c. Yet if the idea falls any thing short
of this minute and absolute knowledge, it can only be an imperfect
and abstract one. The idea of whiteness in the same object (or as a
sensible quality) necessarily implies the same power of <em>abstracting from
particulars</em> in the mind, as the general idea of whiteness taken from
different objects, from a white horse, a white cloud, a white wall, a
white lily, or from all the other white objects I have ever seen.
The precise differences of form, size, and every other actual circumstance
in these particular images, are as little necessary to be
attended to in forming the general idea of whiteness, as the differences
of shape, size, and colour in every particle of the statue of
white marble are to the general impression of colour in the whole
object.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will only add, that the mind has not been fairly dealt with in this
and other questions of the same sort. The difficulties belonging to
the abstraction, complexity, generalization, &#38;c. of our ideas, it is,
perhaps, impossible ever to clear up; but that is no reason why we
should discard these operations from the human mind, any more than
we should deny the existence of motion, of extension, or of curve
lines, because we cannot explain them. Matter alone seems to have
the privilege of presenting difficulties and contradictions at every turn,
which pass current under the name of <em>facts</em>: but the moment any
thing of this kind is observed in the understanding, all the petulance
of logicians is up in arms against it. The mind is made the mark on
which they vent all the moods and figures of their impertinence; and
metaphysical truth has, in this respect, fared like the milk-white hind,
the emblem of pure faith, in Dryden’s fable, which ‘had oft been
chased—</p>

<p class='c007'>The exhibition of this year is, we think, upon the whole, inferior
to the one or two last exhibitions; for though the historical department
is quite as respectably filled, there is not the same proportion of
pleasing representations of common life, and natural scenery. In
spite of certain classical prejudices, we should be sorry to see this
which has been the most successful walk of the modern English
school, neglected for the pursuit of prize-medals and <em>epic mottos</em>, which
look well in the catalogue. There is indeed a greater difference
between an historical picture, and a picture of an historical subject,
than even some eminent painters seem to have imagined. But we
are, we confess, so little refined in our taste, as to prefer a good
imitation of common nature to a bad imitation of the highest, or
rather to an imitation of nothing. Many of the pictures exhibited by
young artists at this Institution, have shewn a capacity for correct and
happy delineation of actual objects and domestic incidents, perhaps
only inferior to the master-pieces of the Dutch school, from the use
of a less perfect vehicle, and the want of long practice, steadily and
uniformly directed to the same object. But in the higher, and what
is rather affectedly called the epic style of art,—in giving the movements
of the loftier and more violent passions, this country has
not a single painter to boast, who has made even a faint approach
to the excellence of the great Italian painters. We have indeed
a good number of specimens of the clay-figure, the bones and
muscles of the man, the anatomical mechanism, the regular proportions
measured by a two-foot rule—large canvasses covered with
stiff figures arranged in decent order, with the characters and
story correctly expressed by uplifted eyes or hands, according to
old receipt-books for the passions, and with all the hardness and
inflexibility of figures carved in wood, and painted over in good
strong body colours, that look as if some of nature’s journeymen
had made them, and not made them well. But we still want a
Prometheus to give life to the cumbrous mass, to throw an intellectual
light over the opaque image, to embody the inmost refinements of
thought to the outward eye, to lay bare the very soul of passion.
That picture is of little comparative value, which can be completely
<em>translated</em> into another language, of which the description in a common
catalogue is as good, and conveys all that is expressed by the picture
itself; for it is the excellence of every art to give what can be given
by no other, in the same degree. Much less is that picture to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>esteemed which only injures and defaces the idea already existing in
the mind’s eye, which does not come up to the conception which
the imagination forms of the subject, and substitutes a dull reality for
high sentiment; for the art is in this case an incumbrance, not an
assistance, and interferes with, instead of adding to, the stock of our
pleasurable sensations. But we should be at a loss to point out (we
will not say any English picture, but certainly) any English painter,
who in heroic and classical composition, has risen to the height of his
subject, and answered the expectation of the well-informed spectator,
or excited the same impression by visible means as had been excited by
words, or by reflection. That this inferiority in English art is not owing
to a deficiency of genius, imagination, or passion, is proved sufficiently
by the works of our poets and dramatic writers, which, in loftiness
and force, are certainly not surpassed by those of any other nation.
But whatever may be the depth of internal thought and feeling in the
English character, it seems to be <em>more internal</em>, and (whether this is
owing to climate, habit, or physical constitution) to have, comparatively,
a less immediate and powerful communication with the organic
expression of passion, which exhibits the thoughts and feelings in the
countenance, and furnishes matter for the historic muse of painting.
The English artist is instantly sensible that the flutter, grimace, and
extravagance of the French physiognomy, are incompatible with
high history; and we are at no loss to explain in this way, that is,
from the defect of existing models, why the productions of the
French school are marked with all the affectation of national caricature,
or sink into tame and lifeless imitations of the antique. May
we not account satisfactorily for the general defects of our own
historic productions in a similar way,—from a certain inertness and
constitutional phlegm, which does not habitually impress the workings
of the mind by correspondent traces on the countenance, and which
may also render us less sensible of these outward and visible signs of
passion, even when they are so impressed there? The irregularity
of proportion and want of symmetry in the structure of the national
features, though it certainly enhances the difficulty of infusing natural
grace and grandeur into the works of art, rather accounts for our not
having been able to attain the exquisite refinements of Grecian sculpture,
than for our not having rivalled the Italian painters in expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strongest exception to these general remarks in the present
collection, is certainly <cite>Mr. Bird’s Picture of Job</cite>, surrounded by his
friends. Many of the heads and figures in this very able composition
have a strong and deeply infused tincture of true history.
The best of them are in a mixed style, which reminds us at the same
time of Annibal Caracci, and N. Poussin. The three finest figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>are undoubtedly those of Job, and the man and woman seated on each
side of him. The countenance of Job displays a noble firmness with
a mixture of suppressed feeling, not, perhaps, sufficiently marked for
the character or for the interest of the subject. The full grey drapery
which envelopes his whole figure, has an admirable effect, and seems
in a manner to shroud him from the attacks of external misfortune, in
the consolations of his own mind. The action of the man on his
right hand, pointing with his finger, and indeed the whole figure, are
equally appropriate and striking. The posture of the man leaning on
a marble slab, is also natural and picturesque, though it has too great
an appearance of ease and indifference for the occasion. The
drapery of this last figure is remarkably loose and flimsy, or what
the painters, we believe, call <em>woolly</em>. There are several other good
heads in the picture; but both the countenance and attitude of the
man behind the messenger, and the face of the figure between Job and
the front figure in red, are mean and vulgar—mere low life, without
sense or dignity. The expression in the countenance of the messenger,
who comes to inform Job of the last calamity that has befallen him,
is neither intelligent nor beautiful; and the whole of the figure, both
by its situation and the quantity of light thrown upon it, assumes a
prominence disproportioned to its importance, and throws the rest of
the composition into a kind of half back-ground. The story is
illustrated (whether with chronological propriety or not we leave to
the critics) by a group of figures just behind the circle of Job and his
friends, carrying off the dead body of one of his children. The
great fault of this picture, which displays much sense, character,
study, and invention, is the heaviness and monotony of the colour. It
is of one uniform leaden tone, as if it had been smeared over with
putty, except where a sudden transition to a glaring red or yellow, or
the introduction of a spotty light, not at all accounted for, serves,
instead of relieving, to add greater weight to that mechanic gloom,
which affects, not the imagination, but the eye. We think it right to
notice a defect which may be more easily remedied by attention, viz.
that the extremities of Mr. Bird’s figures are in general very ill made
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Allston’s large picture of <em>the dead man restored to life by touching
the bones of Elisha</em>, deserves great praise both for the choice and
originality of the subject, the judicious arrangement of the general
composition, and the correct drawing and very great knowledge of
the human figure throughout. The figure of the revived soldier in
the foreground is noble and striking; the drapery about him is
equally well imagined and well executed. There is also a very
beautiful head of a young man in a blue drapery with his hands lifted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>together, and in the act of attention to another, who is pointing out
the miracle, which has much of the simple dignity and pathos of
Raphael. With respect to the general colour and expression of this
picture, we think it has too much of the look of a French composition.
The faces are in the school of Le Brun’s heads—theoretical
diagrams of the passions—not natural and profound expressions of
them; forced and overcharged, without precision or variety of
character. The colouring, too, is without any strongest contrasts or
general gradations, and is half-toned and half-tinted away, between
reddish brown flesh and wan-red drapery, till all effect, union, and
relief, is lost. It would be unjust not to add, that we think Mr.
Allston’s picture demonstrates great talents, great professional acquirements,
and even genius; but we suspect that he has paid too exclusive
an attention to the instrumental and theoretical parts of his art. The
object of art is not merely to display knowledge, but to give pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a small picture of <cite>Diana bathing</cite>, by this gentleman, which
we think equally admirable for the character and drawing. The
knowledge of the human figure in this pleasing composition might be
opposed with advantage to the utter ignorance of it in some Musidora
sketches, in which the limbs seem to have been kneaded in paste, and
are thrown together like a bundle of drapery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of Mr. Hilton’s picture of <cite>Mary Magdalen anointing the feet of our
Saviour</cite>, we have little more to say, than that the figures are much
larger than life, and that, we understand, it has been purchased by
the Institution for 500 guineas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. West’s picture of <cite>Lot and his Family</cite> is one of those highly
finished specimens of <em>metallurgy</em> which too often proceed from the
President’s hardware manufactory. As to the subject, we conceive
it has been often enough treated in a country famed for ‘pure religion
breathing household laws.’ We do not mean to lay it down as a
rule, that the sublimity of the execution may not redeem the deformity
of the subject of a composition, as there is a great and acknowledged
difference between Shakspeare and the Newgate Calendar; but this
of Mr. West’s is a mere furniture picture, and offers no palliation
from the genius displayed by the artist. Having touched unawares on
this very delicate subject of the ethics of painting, we shall just notice,
that the picture of ‘Venus weeping over the dead body of Adonis,’
seems to have been painted <i><span lang="fr">tout expres</span></i>, for the purpose of being
bought up by some member of the Society for the Suppression of Vice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Turner’s grand landscape of <cite>Apullius</cite> and <cite>Apullia</cite> has one
recommendation, which must always enhance the value of this most
able artist’s productions, that the composition is taken <i><span lang="la">verbatim</span></i> from
Lord Egremont’s picture of ‘Jacob and Laban.’ The beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>arrangement is Claude’s; the powerful execution is his own. From
this specimen of parody, and from his never-enough-to-be-admired
picture of ‘Mercury and Herse,’ we could almost wish that this
gentleman would always work in the trammels of Claude or N.
Poussin. All the taste and all the imagination being borrowed, his
powers of eye, hand, and memory, are equal to any thing. In
general, his pictures are a waste of morbid strength. They give
pleasure only by the excess of power triumphing over the barrenness
of the subject. The artist delights to go back to the first chaos of
the world, or to that state when the waters were merely separated
from the dry land, and no creeping thing nor herb bearing fruit was
seen upon the face of the land. The figures in the present picture
are execrable. Claude’s are flimsy enough; but these are impudent
and obtrusive vulgarity. The utter want of a capacity to draw a
distinct outline with the force, the depth, the fulness, and precision of
this artist’s eye for colour, is truly astonishing. There is only one
part of the colouring of Mr. Turner’s landscape which did not please
us: it is the blue of the water nearest the foreground, immediately
after the dark brown shadow of the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>The picture of the <cite>Favourite Lamb</cite>, by Collins, has exquisite feeling.
The groupe of children surrounding the little victim, and
arresting him in his progress to the butcher’s cart, has a degree of
natural pathos and touching simplicity, which we have never seen
surpassed in any picture of the kind. It may easily draw tears from
eyes, at all used to the melting mood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner in which Shakespeare’s plays have been generally
altered, or rather mangled, by modern mechanists, is in our opinion a
disgrace to the English Stage. The patch-work <cite>Richard</cite> which is
acted under the sanction of his name, is a striking example of this
remark. The play itself is undoubtedly one of the finest effusions of
Shakespeare’s genius. It is as truly <em>Shakespearian</em>—that is, it has as
much of the author’s mind, of passion, character, and interest, with as
little alloy of the peculiarities of the age, or extraneous matter, as
almost any other of his productions. Wherever Shakespeare relied
upon himself, and did not appeal to the taste of his audience, he outstripped
all competition, and this he did as often as he had a motive in
his subject to do so; he had none in his vanity, or in the affectation of
conforming to certain critical rules. The winds blow as they list; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the golden tide of passion no sooner rises in his breast, than it swells
and bears down every thing in its mighty course.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ground-work of the character of <em>Richard</em>,—that mixture of
intellectual vigour with moral depravity, in which Shakespeare
delighted to shew his strength,—gave full scope as well as temptation
to the exertion of his genius. The character of his hero is almost
everywhere predominant, and marks its lurid track throughout. The
original play is, however, too long for representation, and there are
some few scenes which might be better spared than preserved and by
omitting which, it would remain a complete whole. The only rule,
indeed, for altering Shakespeare, is to retrench certain passages which
may be considered either as superfluous or obsolete, but not to add or
transpose any thing. The arrangement and developement of the
story, and the mutual contrast and combination of the <i><span lang="la">dramatis
personæ</span></i>, are in general as finely managed as the developement of the
characters or the expression of the passions.</p>

<p class='c007'>This rule has not been adhered to in the present instance. Some of
the most important and striking passages in the principal character
have been omitted, to make room for tedious and misplaced extracts
from other plays; the only intention of which seems to have been, to
make the character of <em>Richard</em> as odious and disgusting as possible.
A bugbear seems to have been always necessary to the English nation,
and—give them but this to vent their spleen upon—they will, either
in matters of taste or opinion, ‘as tenderly be led by the nose as asses
are.’ It is apparently for no other purpose than to make <em>Gloucester</em>
stab <em>King Henry</em> on the stage, that the fine abrupt introduction of this
character in the opening of the play is lost in the tedious whining
morality of the uxorious King (taken from another play);—we say
<em>tedious</em>, because it interrupts the business of the scene, and loses its
beauty and effect by having no intelligible connection with the
previous character of the mild and well-meaning monarch. The
passages which Mr. Wroughton has to recite are in themselves
exquisitely pathetic, but they have nothing to do with the world that
<em>Richard</em> has to ‘bustle in.’ In the same spirit of vulgar caricature is
the scene between <em>Richard</em> and <em>Lady Anne</em> (when his wife)—interpolated,
merely to gratify this favourite propensity to disgust and
loathing. With the same perverse consistency, <em>Richard</em>, after his last
fatal struggle, is raised up by some Galvanic process, to utter the
imprecation, without any motive but pure malignity, which is so finely
put into the mouth of <em>Northumberland</em> on hearing of <em>Percy’s</em> death. We
hope that Mr. Kean, when he acts <cite>Macbeth</cite>, will die as Shakespeare
makes him, and not with four lines of canting penitence (a common-place
against ambition) in his mouth. To make room for these needless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>additions and interpolations, many of the most striking passages in
the real play have been omitted by the foppery and ignorance of the
prompt-book critics. We do not mean to insist merely on passages
which are fine as poetry and to the reader, such as <em>Clarence’s</em> dream,
&#38;c. but those which are important to the developement of the
character, and peculiarly adapted for stage effect. We give the
following as instances among many others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first is the scene where <em>Richard</em> enters abruptly to the Queen
and her friends, to defend himself:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Gloucester</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo.</em> They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who are they that complain unto the King,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</div>
      <div class='line'>By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because I cannot flatter, and look fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,</div>
      <div class='line'>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot a plain man live, and think no harm,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thus his simple truth must be abused</div>
      <div class='line'>With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Gray.</em> To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo.</em> To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace;</div>
      <div class='line'>When have I injured thee? When done thee wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?</div>
      <div class='line'>A plague upon you all!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What can be more characteristic than the turbulent pretensions to
meekness and simplicity in this address?</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, the versatility and adroitness of <em>Richard</em> is admirably
described in the following ironical answer to Brakenbury:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brakenbury.</em> I beseech your graces both to pardon me,</div>
      <div class='line'>His Majesty hath straitly given in charge,</div>
      <div class='line'>That no man shall have private conference,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of what degree soever, with your brother.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo.</em> E’en so, and please your worship, Brakenbury,</div>
      <div class='line'>You may partake of any thing we say:</div>
      <div class='line'>We speak not reason, man—we say the King</div>
      <div class='line'>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble Queen</div>
      <div class='line'>Well strook in years, fair, and not jealous.</div>
      <div class='line'>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>A cherry lip, a passing pleasing tongue:</div>
      <div class='line'>That the Queen’s kindred are made gentle folks.</div>
      <div class='line'>How say you, Sir? Can you deny all this?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span><em>Brak.</em> With this, my Lord, myself have nought to do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo.</em> What, fellow, nought to do with Mistress Shore?</div>
      <div class='line'>I tell you, Sir, he that doth nought with her,</div>
      <div class='line'>Excepting one, were best to do it secretly alone.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brak.</em> What one, my Lord?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo.</em> Her husband, knave—wouldst thou betray me?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The feigned reconciliation of Gloucester with the Queen’s kinsmen,
is also a master-piece. One of the finest features in the play, and
which serves to shew, as much as any thing, the deep duplicity of
<em>Richard</em>, is the unsuspecting security of <em>Hastings</em>, at the very time
when the former is plotting his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the two most beautiful passages in the original, are the
farewell apostrophe of the <em>Queen</em> to the Tower, where her children are
shut up from her, and <em>Tyrrel’s</em> description of their death. We will
finish our quotations with them:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Queen.</em> Stay, yet look back with me, unto the Tower;</div>
      <div class='line'>Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom envy hath immured within your walls;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rough cradle for such little pretty ones;</div>
      <div class='line'>Rude, rugged nurse, old sullen playfellow,</div>
      <div class='line'>For tender princes!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The other passage is the account of their death by <em>Tyrrel</em>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn</div>
      <div class='line'>To do this piece of ruthless butchery,</div>
      <div class='line'>Albeit they were flesh’d villains, bloody dogs,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wept like to children in their death’s sad story:</div>
      <div class='line'>O thus! quoth Dighton, lay the gentle babes;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, thus! quoth Forrest, girdling one another,</div>
      <div class='line'>Within their innocent alabaster arms;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in that summer-beauty kiss’d each other;</div>
      <div class='line'>A book of prayers on their pillow lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which once, quoth Forrest, almost changed my mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>But Oh the Devil!—there the villain stopped:</div>
      <div class='line'>When Dighton thus told on—we smothered</div>
      <div class='line'>The most replenished sweet work of nature,</div>
      <div class='line'>That from the prime creation ere she framed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These are those wonderful bursts of feeling, done to the very height
of nature which our Shakespeare alone could give. We do not
insist on the repetition of these last passages as proper for the stage;
we should indeed be loth to trust them with almost any actor; but we
should wish them to be retained, at least in preference to the fantoccini
exhibition of the young Princes, bandying childish wit with their uncle.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>We have taken the present opportunity to offer these remarks on the
necessity of acting the plays of our great Bard, in spirit and substance,
instead of burlesquing them, because we think the stage has acquired
in Mr. Kean an actor capable of doing singular justice to many of his
finest delineations of character.</p>

or why should they shew it any mercy? Will they spare the
precious works of art, to decorate the palace of a monster whom
they justly detest? Will they treat the Thuileries more tenderly
than the French Officers, only eight months ago, openly threatened
to treat Berlin? Is Paris, Bonaparte’s Paris, more sacred than
Moscow? or are the slaves of the Corsican more inviolable than the

<p class='c007'>‘There is no other mode by which the Parisians can disarm the
vengeance which now so closely impends over them, than by disclaiming
for ever him whose crimes have been the just cause of that
vengeance. Paris under the white standard, returning to loyalty and
virtue, may be spared by a generous conqueror;—but Paris, identified
with Bonaparte, must partake all the vindictive sentiments which are
attached to that hateful name.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Yet some time ago this writer assured us that if the French
people identified themselves with Bonaparte, they ought not to be
separated from him.]</p>

<p class='c007'>‘In what momentous times do we live! Perhaps, the famous city
of which we speak may even now be laid in ashes! Perhaps and
more welcome be the omen, it may have returned to its allegiance,
and proclaimed its native Sovereign, and set a price on the head of

<p class='c007'>It is a pity to spoil this morsel of Asiatic eloquence, so worthy of
the subject and the sentiments; but the evident meaning of it is, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the French must expect to do penance in sack-cloth and ashes, or
consent to put on the old livery jackets, made up for them by our
army-agents long ago, and which have unfortunately lain on hand ever
since. If so, they must needs be ‘pigeon-liver’d, and lack gall.’
Yet we hardly know what to say to the chivalrous and classical
politicians of the Stock Exchange. They are not driven to the
extremity of Gothic rage by the ranking inveteracy, and old
unsatisfied grudge of the Pitt-school. Yet surely no pitiable
enthusiast that</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>can be more incorrigible to reason. They are always setting out on
their way to Paris from Moscow, while the Pitt-school studiously
return to join Lord Hawkesbury in the year 1793, or they think the
whole ceremony incomplete! The treaty of Pilnitz does not stand
between our modern popular incendiaries and their just revenge!
They live only in ‘this present ignorant time!’ They see the
white standard of the Bourbons waving over the walls of Paris,
unspotted with the blood of millions of Frenchmen! They do not
seem ever to have known, or (with our poet-laureat) they forget, that
the same standard to which our milky politicians advise the French
people, sick of destruction, and panting for freedom, to fly for deliverance
and repose, is that very standard, which, for twenty years,
hovering round them, now seen like a cloudy speck in the distance—now
spreading out its drooping lilies wide, has been the cause of
that destruction—has robbed them at once of liberty and of repose!</p>

<p class='c007'>Moscow is, however, the watch-word of the renegados of <cite>The
Times</cite>. It seems to them just that Paris should be sacrificed to
revenge the setting fire to Moscow by the Russians, and that the
monuments of art in the Louvre ought to be destroyed because they
are Bonaparte’s. No; they are ours as well as his;—they belong to
the human race; he cannot monopolize all genius and all art. But
these madmen would, if they could, blot the Sun out of heaven,
because it shines upon France. They verify the old proverb,
‘Tell me your company, and I’ll tell you your manners!’
They, no more than their friends the Cossacks, can perceive any
difference between the Kremlin and the Louvre. There is at least
one difference, that the one may be built up again, and the other
cannot. For there, in the Louvre, in Bonaparte’s Louvre, are
the precious monuments of art—the sacred pledges which human
genius has given to time and nature;—there ‘stands the statue that
enchants the world;’ there is the <cite>Apollo</cite>, the <cite>Laocoon</cite>, the <cite>Dying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Gladiator</cite>, the <cite>Head of the Antinous</cite>, <cite>Diana with her Fawn</cite>, and all
the glories of the antique world;—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There is old Proteus coming from the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wreathed Triton blows his winding horn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>There, too, are the two <cite>St. Jeromes</cite>, Correggio’s and Dominichino’s;
there is Raphael’s <cite>Transfiguration</cite>, the <cite>St. Mark</cite> of Tintoret, Paul
Veronese’s <cite>Marriage of Cana</cite>, the <cite>Deluge</cite> of Nicholas Poussin, and
Titian’s <cite>St. Peter Martyr</cite>;—all these, and more than these, of which
the world is scarce worthy. Yet all these amount to nothing in the
eyes of those virtuosos the Cossacks, and their fellow-students of <cite>The
Times</cite>! ‘What’s Hecuba to them, or they to Hecuba?’ But we
must be allowed to see with our own eyes, and to have certain
feelings of our own. We will not be brayed by these quacks <em>like
fools in a mortar</em>. We too, as Mr. Burke expresses it, have ‘real
feelings of flesh and blood beating in our bosoms.’ ‘We look up
with awe to Kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to
magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility.’
But all this is a machine that goes on of itself, and may be repaired
if out of order. We bow willingly to Lords and Commoners,
though we know that ‘breath can make them as a breath has made.’
Blücher, Wittgenstein, Winzingerode, and Ktzichigoff, are true
heroes; their names become the mouth well, and rouse the ear as the
sound of a trumpet; but they are the heroes of a day, and all that
they have done might be as well done by others to-morrow. But
here it is: once destroy the great monuments of art, and they cannot
be replaced. Those mighty geniuses, who have left their works
behind them an inheritance to mankind, live but once to do honour to
themselves and their nature. ‘But once put out their light, and
there is no Promethean heat that can their light relumine.’ Nor
ought it ever to be re-kindled, to be extinguished a second time by
the harpies of the human race. What have ‘the worshippers of cats
and onions’ to do with those triumphs of human genius, which give
the eternal lie to their creed? We would therefore recommend
these accomplished pioneers of civilisation and social order, after they
have done their work at the Louvre, to follow the river-side, and
they will come to a bare inclosure, surrounded by four low walls.
It is the place where the Bastille stood: let them rear that, and all
will be well. And then some whiffling poet who celebrated the fall
of that monument of mild paternal sway—that sacred ark of the
confidence of Kings—that strong bulwark of ‘time-hallowed laws,’
and precious relic of ‘the good old times,’ in an ode, may hail its
restoration in a sonnet!</p>

<p class='c007'>The landscapes of this celebrated artist may be divided into three
classes;—his Italian landscapes, or imitations of the manner of
Claude, his copies of English scenery, and his historical compositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of these are, in our opinion, by much the best; and of
the pictures of this class in the present collection, we should, without
any hesitation, give the preference to the <cite>Apollo and the Seasons</cite>, and
to the <cite>Phaeton</cite>. The figures are of course out of the question—(Wilson’s
figures are as uncouth and slovenly as Claude’s are insipid
and finical)—but the landscape in both pictures is delightful. In
looking at them we breath the very air which the scene inspires, and
feel the genius of the place present to us. In the first, there is all
the cool freshness of a misty spring morning: the sky, the water, the
dim horizon all convey the same feeling. The fine grey tone, and
varying outline of the hills, the graceful form of the retiring lake,
broken still more by the hazy shadows of the objects that repose on
its bosom; the light trees that expand their branches in the air, and
the dark stone figure and mouldering temple, that contrast strongly
with the broad clear light of the rising day, give a charm, a truth, a
force and harmony to this landscape, which produce the greater
pleasure the longer it is dwelt on.—The distribution of light and
shade resembles the effect of light on a globe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Phaeton</cite> has the dazzling fervid appearance of an autumnal
evening; the golden radiance streams in solid masses from behind the
flickering clouds; every object is baked in the sun;—the brown foreground,
the thick foliage of the trees, the streams shrunk and stealing
along behind the dark high banks, combine to produce that richness,
and characteristic propriety of effect, which is to be found only in
nature, or in art derived from the study and imitation of nature.
The glowing splendour of this landscape reminds us of the saying
of Wilson, that in painting such subjects, he endeavoured to give the
effect of insects dancing in the evening sun. His eye seemed formed
to drink in the light. These two pictures, as they have the greatest
general effect, are also more carefully finished in the particular details
than the other pictures in the collection. This circumstance may be
worth the attention of those who are apt to think that strength and
slovenliness are the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Cicero at his Villa</cite> is a clear and beautiful representation of nature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>The sky is admirable for its pure azure tone. Among the less
finished productions of Wilson’s pencil, which display his great
knowledge of perspective, are <cite>A Landscape with figures bathing</cite>, in
which the figures are wonderfully detached from the sea beyond;
and <cite>A View in Italy</cite>, with a lake and a little boat, which appear
at an immeasurable distance below:—the boat is diminished to</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>A View of Ancona</cite>; <cite>Adrian’s Villa at Rome</cite>; a small blue greenish
landscape; <cite>The Lake of Neimi</cite>; a small, richly-coloured landscape of
the banks of a river; and a landscape containing some light and
elegant groups of trees, are masterly and interesting sketches. <cite>A View
on the Tiber</cite>, near Rome, a dark landscape which lies finely open to
the sky; and <cite>A View of Rome</cite>, are successful imitations of N. Poussin.
<cite>A View of Sion House</cite>, which is hung almost out of sight, is remarkable
for the clearness of the perspective, particularly in the distant
windings of the River Thames, and still more so for the parched and
droughty appearance of the whole scene. The air is adust, the grass
burned up and withered: and it seems as if some figures, reposing on
the level, smooth shaven lawn on the river’s side, would be annoyed
by the parching heat of the ground. We consider this landscape,
which is an old favourite, as one of the most striking proofs of
Wilson’s genius, as it conveys not only the image, but the feeling of
nature, and excites a new interest unborrowed from the eye, like
the fine glow of a summer’s day. There is a sketch of the same
subject, called <cite>A View on the Thames</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>A View near Llangollen, North Wales</cite>; <cite>Oakhampton Castle, Devonshire</cite>;
and <cite>The Bridge at Llangollen</cite>, are the principal of Wilson’s
English landscapes. They want almost every thing that ought to recommend
them. The subjects are not fit for the landscape-painter, and
there is nothing in the execution to redeem them. Ill-shaped mountains,
or great heaps of earth, trees that grow against them without
character or elegance, motionless water-falls, a want of relief, of transparency,
and distance,—without the imposing grandeur of real magnitude
(which it is either not within the province of the art to give, or which
is certainly not given here), are the chief features and defects of these
pictures.—The same general objections apply to <cite>Solitude</cite>, and to one
or two pictures near it, which are masses of common-place confusion.
In near scenes, the effect must depend almost entirely on the difference
in the execution, and the details: for the difference of colour alone
is not sufficient to give relief to objects placed at a small distance
from the eye. But in Wilson there are commonly no details; all is
loose and general; and this very circumstance, which assisted him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in giving the massy contrasts of light and shade, deprived his pencil
of all force and precision within a limited space. In general, air
is necessary to the landscape-painter: and for this reason, the lakes
of Cumberland and Westmoreland afford few subjects for landscape-painting.
However stupendous the scenery of that country is, and
however powerful and lasting the impression which it must always
make on the imagination, yet the effect is not produced merely
through the eye of the spectator, but arises chiefly from collateral
and associated feelings. There is the knowledge of the distance
from which we have seen the objects, in the midst of which we are
now placed,—the slow, improgressive motion which we make in
traversing them,—the abrupt precipice,—the torrent’s roar,—the
dizzy rapture and boundless expanse of the prospect from the highest
mountains,—the difficulty of their ascent,—their loneliness, and
silence;—in short, there is a constant sense and superstitious awe
of the collective power of matter, of the gigantic and eternal forms
of nature, on which from the beginning of time the hand of man has
made no impression, and which by the lofty reflections they excite in
him, give a sort of intellectual sublimity even to his sense of physical
weakness. But there is little in all these circumstances that can be
translated into the picturesque, which depends not on the objects
themselves, so much as on the symmetry and relation of these objects
to one another. In a picture a mountain shrinks to a molehill, and
the lake that expands its broad bosom to the sky, seems hardly big
enough to launch a fleet of cockle-shells.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wilson’s historical landscapes, the two <cite>Niobes</cite>, <cite>Celadon and Amelia</cite>,
<cite>Meleager and Atalanta</cite>, do not, in our opinion, deserve the name;
that is, they do not excite feelings corresponding with the scene and
story represented. They neither display true taste nor fine imagination;
but are affected and violent exaggerations of clumsy, common
nature. They are all made up of the same mechanical materials, an
overhanging rock, bare shattered trees, black rolling clouds, and
forked lightning. The scene of <cite>Celadon and Amelia</cite>, though it may
be proper for a thunder-storm, is not a place for lovers to walk in.
The <cite>Meleager and Atalanta</cite> is remarkable for nothing but a castle at
a distance, very much ‘resembling a goose-pye.’ The figures in the
two other pictures are not like the children of <cite>Niobe</cite>, punished by the
Gods, but like a groupe of rustics, crouching from a hail-storm. In
one of these, however, there is a fine break in the sky worthy of the
subject. We agree with Sir J. Reynolds, that Wilson’s mind was
not, like N. Poussin’s, sufficiently imbued with the knowledge of
antiquity to transport the imagination two thousand years back, to
give natural objects a sympathy with preternatural events, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>inform rocks, and trees, and mountains with the presence of a
God.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The writer of the Preface to the Catalogue of the British Gallery,
says—‘Few artists have excelled Wilson in the tint of air, perhaps
the most difficult point of attainment for the landscape-painter: every
object in his pictures keeps its place, because each is seen through its
proper medium. <cite>This excellence alone</cite> gives a charm to his pencil, and
by judicious application may be turned to the advantage of the British
artist.’—This praise is equivocal: if it be meant that ‘the tint of air’
is the only excellence of Wilson’s landscapes, the observation is not
true. He had also great truth, harmony, and richness of local
colouring: he had a fine feeling of the proportions and conduct of
light and shade; and, in general, an eye for graceful form, as far as
regards the bold and varying outlines of indefinite objects—as may be
seen in his foregrounds, hills, etc.—where the mind is left to chuse
according to an abstract principle, as it is filled or affected agreeably
by certain combinations,—and is not tied down to an imitation of
characteristic and articulate forms. In his figures, trees, cattle,
buildings and in every thing which has a determinate and regular
form, Wilson’s pencil was not only deficient in accuracy of outline,
but even in perspective and actual relief. His trees, in particular,
seem pasted on the canvas, like botanical specimens.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall close these remarks with observing, that we cannot
subscribe to the opinion of those who assert that Wilson was superior
to Claude as a man of genius: nor can we discern any other grounds
for this opinion, than those which lead to the general conclusion, that
the more slovenly the performance, the finer the picture; and that
that which is imperfect is superior to that which is perfect. It might
as well be said, that a sign-painting is better than the reflection of a
landscape in a mirror; and the only objection that can be made in
the latter case cannot be made to the landscapes of Claude, for in
them the Graces themselves have, with their own hands, assisted in
disposing and selecting every object.—Is the general effect in his
pictures injured by the details? Is the truth inconsistent with the
beauty of the imitation? Are the scope and harmony of the whole
destroyed by the exquisite delicacy of every part? Does the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>perpetual profusion of objects and scenery, all perfect in themselves,
interfere with the simple grandeur, and immense extent of the whole?
Does the precision with which a plant is marked in the foreground,
take away from the air-drawn distinctions of the blue, glimmering
distant horizon? Is there any want of that endless airy space, where
the eye wanders at liberty under the open sky, explores distant
objects, and returns back as from a delightful journey? There is
no comparison between him and Wilson. The landscapes of Claude
have all that is exquisite and refined in art and nature. Every thing
is moulded into grace and harmony; and at the touch of his pencil,
shepherds with their flocks, temples and groves, and winding glades,
and scattered hamlets, rise up in never-ending succession, under the
azure sky, and the resplendent sun, ‘while universal Pan,</p>

<p class='c007'>There is an anecdote connected with the reputation of Gainsborough’s
Pictures, which rests on pretty good authority. Sir Joshua Reynolds,
at one of the Academy dinners, speaking of Gainsborough, said to a
friend, ‘He is undoubtedly the best English landscape-painter.’
‘No,’ said Wilson, who overheard the conversation, ‘he’s not the
best English landscape-painter, but he is the best portrait-painter in
England.’ They were certainly both wrong; but the story is
creditable to the variety of Gainsborough’s talents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of his portraits, in the present collection at the British Gallery,
the only fine one is <cite>A Portrait of a Youth</cite>. This picture is from
Lord Grosvenor’s collection, where it used to look remarkably well,
and has been sometimes mistaken for a Vandyke. There is a spirited
glow of youth about the face, and the attitude is striking and elegant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The drapery of blue satin is admirably painted. The <cite>Portrait of
Garrick</cite> is interesting as a piece of biography. He looks much more
like a gentleman than in Reynolds’s tragi-comic representation of him.—There
is a considerable lightness and intelligence in the expression
of the face, and a piercing vivacity about the eyes, to which the
attention is immediately directed. Gainsborough’s own portrait,
which has, however, much truth and character, and makes a fine
print, seems to have been painted with the handle of his brush.
There is a portrait of <cite>The Prince Regent leading a horse</cite>, in which it
must be confessed the man has the advantage of the animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gainsborough’s landscapes are of two classes, or periods; his early
and his later pictures. The former are, we imagine, the best. They
are imitations of nature, or of painters who imitated nature;—such as
a <cite>Woody Scene</cite>; another, which is a fine imitation of Ruysdale; and
a <cite>Road Side, with figures</cite>, which has great truth and clearness. His
later pictures are flimsy caricatures of Rubens, who himself carried
inattention to accuracy of detail to the utmost limit that it would bear.
Lord Bacon says, that ‘distilled books are, like distilled waters,
flashy things.’ The same may be said of pictures.—Gainsborough’s
latter landscapes are bad water-colour drawings, washed in by
mechanical movements of the hand, without any communication with
the eye. The truth seems to be, that Gainsborough found there
was something wanting in his ‘<em>early manner</em>,’—that is, something
beyond mere literal imitation of natural objects, and he seems to have
concluded, rather hastily, that the way to arrive at that <em>something more</em>,
was to discard truth and nature altogether. He accordingly ran from
one extreme into the other. We cannot conceive anything carried to
a greater excess of slender execution and paltry glazing, than <cite>A Fox
hunted with grey-hounds</cite>, <cite>A romantic Landscape with Sheep at a
Fountain</cite>, and many others. We were, however, much pleased with
an upright landscape, with figures, which has a fine, fresh appearance
of the open sky, with a dash of the wildness of Salvator Rosa; and
also with <cite>A Bank of a River</cite>, which is remarkable for the elegance
of the forms and the real delicacy of the execution. <cite>A Group
of Cattle in a warm Landscape</cite> is an evident imitation of Rubens,
but no more like to Rubens than ‘I to Hercules.’ <cite>Landscape with a
Waterfall</cite> should be noticed for the sparkling clearness of the
distance. <cite>Sportsmen in a Landscape</cite> is copied from Teniers with
much taste and feeling, though very inferior to the original picture
in Lord Radnor’s collection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the fancy pictures, on which Gainsborough’s fame chiefly rests,
we are disposed to give the preference to his <cite>Cottage Children</cite>.
There is, we apprehend, greater truth, variety, force, and character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in this groupe, than in any other. The colouring of the light-haired
child is particularly true to nature, and forms a sort of natural and
innocent contrast to the dark complexion of the elder sister, who is
carrying it. <cite>The Girl going to the Well</cite> is, however, the general
favourite. The little dog is certainly admirable. His hair looks as
if it had been just washed and combed. The attitude of the <cite>Girl</cite> is
also perfectly easy and natural. But there is a consciousness in the
turn of the head, and a sentimental pensiveness in the expression,
which is not taken from nature, but intended as an improvement
on it. There is a regular insipidity, a systematic vacancy, a round,
unvaried smoothness, to which real nature is a stranger, and which
is only an idea existing in the painter’s mind. We think the
gloss of art is never so ill bestowed as on subjects of this kind,
which ought to be studies of natural history. It is perhaps the
general fault of Gainsborough, that he presents us with an ideal
common life, whereas it is only the reality that is here good for any
thing. His subjects are softened and sentimentalised too much,
it is not simple, unaffected nature that we see, but nature sitting for
her picture. Gainsborough, we suspect, from some of the pictures in
this collection, led the way to that masquerade style, which piques
itself on giving the air of an Adonis to the driver of a hay-cart, and
models the features of a milk-maid on the principles of the antique.
The <cite>Girl and Pigs</cite> is hardly liable to this objection. There is a
healthy glow in the girl’s face, which seems the immediate effect of
the air blowing upon it. The expression is not quite so good. The
<cite>Fox-dogs</cite> are admirable. The young one is even better than the old
one, and has undeniable hereditary pretensions. The <cite>Shepherd Boys</cite>
are fine. We do not like the <cite>Boys with Dogs fighting</cite>. We see no
reason why the one should be so handsome and the other so ugly, why
the one should be so brown and the other so yellow, or why their
dogs should be of the same colour as themselves: nor why the worst-looking
of the two should be most anxious to part the fray. The
sketch of the <cite>Woodman</cite>, the original of which was unfortunately
burned, fully justifies all the reputation it has acquired. It is a really
fine study from nature. There is a picture of Gainsborough’s somewhere
of <cite>A Shepherd Boy in a Storm</cite>, of which we many years ago
saw an indifferent copy in a broker’s shop, but in which the unconscious
simplicity of the boy’s expression, looking up with his hands
folded, and with timid wonder, the noisy chattering of a magpye
perched above him, and the rustling of the coming storm in the
branches of the trees, produced a romantic pastoral impression, which
we have often recalled with no little pleasure since that time. We
have always, indeed, felt a strong prepossession in favor of Gainsborough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>and were disappointed at not finding his pictures in the
present collection, all that we had wished to find them.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was to be considered, perhaps, rather as a man of taste, and of
an elegant and feeling mind, than as a man of genius; as a lover of
the art, rather than an artist. He pursued it, with a view to amuse
and sooth his mind, with the ease of a gentleman, not with the
severity of a professional student. He wished to make his pictures,
like himself, amiable; but a too constant desire to please almost
necessarily leads to affectation and effeminacy. He wanted that
vigour of intellect, which perceives the beauty of truth; and thought
that painting was to be gained, like other mistresses, by flattery and
smiles. It is an error which we are disposed to forgive in one,
around whose memory, both as a man and an artist, many fond
recollections, many vain regrets must always linger. Peace to his
shade!<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kemble lately appeared at this theatre in the character of
Penruddock, and was received (not indeed with waving handkerchiefs,
and laurel garlands thrown on the stage, but what is much
better) with heart-felt approbation and silent tears. His delineation
of the part is one of his most correct and interesting performances,
and one of the most perfect on the modern stage. The deeply
rooted, mild, pensive melancholy of the character, its embittered
recollections and dignified benevolence, were given by Mr. Kemble
with equal truth, elegance, and feeling. This admirable actor appeared
to be the unfortunate, but amiable individual whom he represented;
and the expression of the sentiments, the look, the tone of voice,
exactly true to nature, struck a correspondent chord in every bosom.—The
range of characters, in which Mr. Kemble shines, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>superior to every other actor, are those which consist in the developement
of some one sentiment or exclusive passion. From a want of
rapidity, of scope, and variety, he is often deficient in expressing the
bustle and complication of different interests, nor does he possess the
faculty of overpowering the mind by sudden and irresistible bursts of
passion. But in giving the habitual workings of a predominant feeling,
as in Penruddock, Coriolanus, and some others, where all the passions
move round a central point, and have one master key, he stands
unrivalled. In Penruddock, he broods over the recollection of
disappointed hope, till it becomes a part of himself, it sinks deeper
into his mind the longer he dwells upon it, and his whole person is
moulded to the character. The weight of sentiment which oppresses
him never seems suspended, the spring at his heart is never lightened,
his regrets only become more profound as they become more durable.
So in Coriolanus, he exhibits the ruling passion with the same
continued firmness, he preserves the same haughty dignity of
demeanour, the same energy of will, and unbending sternness of
temper throughout. He is swayed by a single impulse. His
tenaciousness of purpose is only irritated by opposition: he turns
neither to the right nor to the left: but the vehemence with which
he moves forward increases every instant, till it hurries him to the
catastrophe. In Leontes, in the Winter’s Tale, the growing jealousy
of the king, and the exclusive possession which it at length obtains
of his mind, are marked in the finest manner, particularly where he
exclaims—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Is whispering nothing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?</div>
      <div class='line'>Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career</div>
      <div class='line'>Of laughter with a sigh, a note infallible</div>
      <div class='line'>Of breaking honesty? horsing foot on foot?</div>
      <div class='line'>Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?</div>
      <div class='line'>Hours minutes? the noon, midnight? and all eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Blind with the pin and web, but theirs; theirs only</div>
      <div class='line'>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why then the world and all that’s in ‘t is nothing.</div>
      <div class='line'>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,</div>
      <div class='line'>My wife is nothing, if this be nothing.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the course of this enumeration every proof tells harder, his
conviction becomes more rivetted at every step of his progress, and
at the end his mind is wound up to a frenzy of despair. In such
characters, Mr. Kemble has no occasion to call in the resources of
invention, or the tricks of the art; his excellence consists entirely in
the increasing intensity with which he dwells on a given feeling or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>enforces a predominant passion. In Hamlet, on the contrary, Mr.
Kemble unavoidably fails from a want of flexibility, or of that quick
sensibility, which yields to every motive, and is borne away with
every breath of fancy, which is distracted by the multiplicity of its
reflections, and lost in its own purposes. There is a perpetual undulation
of feeling in the character of Hamlet (though it must be
confessed, much of this, which is the essence of the play, is left out
on the stage), but in Mr. Kemble’s acting ‘there is no variableness
nor shadow of turning.’ He plays it like a man in armour, with a
determined inveteracy of purpose, in one undeviating strait line,
which is as remote from the natural grace and easy susceptibility of
the character, as the sharp angles and abrupt starts to produce an
effect, which Mr. Kean introduces into it. Mr. Kean’s Hamlet is,
in our opinion, as much too ‘splenetic and rash,’ as Mr. Kemble’s is
too deliberate and formal. In Richard, Mr. Kemble has not that
tempest and whirlwind of the passions, that life and spirit, and
dazzling rapidity of motion, which, as it were, fills the stage, and
burns in every part, which Mr. Kean displayed in it till he was worn
out by the managers. Mr. Kean’s acting, in general, strongly
reminds us of the lines of the poet, when he describes</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The fiery soul that working out its way</div>
      <div class='line'>Fretted the pigmy body to decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’erinformed the tenement of clay.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Kemble’s manner on the contrary has always something dry,
hard and pedantic in it. ‘You shall relish him more in the scholar
than the soldier.’ But his monotony does not fatigue, his formality
does not displease, because there is always sense and feeling in what
he does. The fineness of Mr. Kemble’s figure has perhaps led to
that statue-like appearance which his acting is sometimes too apt to
assume; as the diminutiveness of Mr. Kean’s person has probably
forced him to bustle about too much, and to attempt to make up for
the want of dignity of form by the violence and contrast of his
attitudes. If Mr. Kemble were to remain in the same posture for
half an hour, his figure would only produce admiration—if Mr. Kean
were to stand still only for a moment, the contrary effect would be
produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to Penruddock and the Wheel of Fortune. The only
novelties were Miss Foote in Emily Tempest, and her lover, Mr.
Farley, as Sir David Daw. The latter, who is a Welch Adonis of
five-and-twenty, from the natural advantages of his person, and the
artificial improvements which were added to it, was a very admirable
likeness, on a reduced scale, of the Prince Regent. We do not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>whether the burlesque was intended, but it had a laughable effect.
We acknowledge that Mr. Farley is one of those persons whom we
always welcome heartily when we see him. What with laughing at
him and laughing with him, we hardly know a more comic personage.
Miss Foote played and looked the part of Emily Tempest very
naturally and very prettily, but without giving to the character either
much interest or much elegance. Her voice is in itself as sweet as
her person, and when she exerts it, she articulates with ease and
clearness: but we should add, that she has a habit of tripping in her
common speaking, that is, of dropping her voice so low, except where
a particular emphasis is to be laid, as to make it difficult for the ear to
follow the sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general merit of these Discourses is so well established that it
would be needless to enlarge on it here. The graces of the composition
are such, that scholars have been led to suspect that it was the
style of Burke (the first prose-writer of our time) carefully subdued,
and softened down to perfection: and the taste and knowledge of the
subject displayed in them are so great, that this work has been, by
common consent, considered as a text-book on the subject of art, in
our English school of painting, ever since its publication. Highly
elegant and valuable as Sir Joshua’s opinions are, yet they are
liable (so it appears to us) to various objections; and it becomes
more important to state these objections, because, as it generally
happens, the most questionable of his precepts are those which have
been the most eagerly adopted, and carried into practice with the
greatest success. The errors, if they are such, which we shall
attempt to point out, are not casual, but systematic. There is a finespun
metaphysical theory, either not very clearly understood, or not
very correctly expressed, pervading Sir Joshua’s reasoning; and
which appears to have led him in several of the most important points
to conclusions, either false or only true in part.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The rules thus laid
down, as general and comprehensive maxims, are in fact founded on
a set of half principles, which are true only as far as they imply
a negation of the opposite errors, but contain in themselves the germ
of other errors just as fatal: which, if strictly and literally understood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>cannot be defended, and which by being taken in an equivocal sense,
of course leave the student as much to seek as ever. The English school
of painting is universally reproached by foreigners with the slovenly
and unfinished state in which they send their productions into the
world, with their ignorance of academic rules and neglect of the
subordinate details; in other words, with aiming at <em>effect</em> only in all
their works of art: and though it is by no means necessary that we
should adopt the defects of the French and German painters, yet we
might learn from them to correct our own. There was no occasion
to encourage our constitutional indolence and impatience by positive
rules, or to incorporate our vicious habits into a system. Or if our
defects were to be retained, at least they ought to have been tolerated
only for the sake of certain collateral and characteristic excellencies
out of which they might be thought to spring. Thus a certain degree
of precision or regularity might be sacrificed rather than impair that
boldness, vigour, and originality of conception, in which the strength
of the national genius might be supposed to lie. But the method of
instruction pursued in the Discourses seems calculated for neither of
these objects. Without endeavouring to overcome our habitual
defects, which might be corrected by proper care and study, it damps
our zeal, ardour, and enthusiasm. It places a full reliance neither on
art nor nature, but consists in a kind of fastidious tampering with
both. Both genius and industry are put out of countenance in turn.
The height of invention is made to consist in compiling from others,
and the perfection of imitation in not copying from nature. We lose
the substance of the art in catching at a shadow, and are thought to
embrace a cloud for a Goddess!</p>

<p class='c007'>That we may not seem to prejudge the question, we shall state at
once, and without further preface, the principal points in the Discourses
which we deem either wrong in themselves, or liable to misconception
and abuse. They are the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>That genius or invention consists chiefly in borrowing the ideas of
others, or in using other men’s minds.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>That the great style in painting depends on leaving out the details of
particular objects.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>That the essence of portrait consists in giving the general character,
rather than the individual likeness.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>That the essence of history consists in abstracting from individuality
of character and expression as much as possible.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>That beauty or ideal perfection consists in a central form.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>6. <em>That to imitate nature is a very inferior object in art.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>All of these positions appear to require a separate consideration,
which we shall give them in the following articles on this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a leading and favourite position of the Discourses that genius
and invention are principally shewn in borrowing the ideas, and
imitating the excellences of others. Differing entirely from those
‘who have undertaken to write on the art of painting, and have
represented it as a kind of <em>inspiration</em>, as a <em>gift</em> bestowed upon peculiar
favourites at their birth,’ Sir Joshua proceeds to add, ‘I am, on the
contrary, persuaded, that by imitation only,’ (that is, of former
masters,) ‘variety and even originality of invention is produced. I
will go further! even genius, at least what is generally called so, is
the child of imitation.’ ‘There can be no doubt but that he who has
most materials has the greatest means of invention; and if he has not
the power of using them, it must proceed from a feebleness of intellect.’
‘Study is the art of using other men’s minds.’ ‘It is from Raphael’s
having taken so many models, that he became himself a model for all
succeeding painters; always imitating, and always original.’ Vol. i.
p. 151, 159, 169, &#38;c. All that Sir Joshua says on this subject, is
either vague and contradictory, or has an evident bias the wrong way.
That genius either consists in, or is in any proportion to, the knowledge
of what others have done, in any branch of art or science, is a
paradox which hardly admits serious refutation. The answer is
indeed so obvious and so undeniable, that one is almost ashamed to
give it. As it happens in all such cases, an advantage is taken of the
old-fashioned simplicity of truth to triumph over it. It is another of
Sir Joshua’s theoretical opinions, often repeated, and almost as often
retracted in his lectures, that there is no such thing as genius in the
first formation of the human mind. That is not the question here,
though perhaps we may recur to it. But, however a man may come
by the faculty which we call <em>genius</em>, whether it is the effect of habit
and circumstances, or the gift of nature, yet there can be no doubt,
that what is meant by the term, is a power of original observation and
invention. To take it otherwise, is a solecism in language, and a
misnomer in art. A work demonstrates genius exactly as it contains
what is to be found no where else, or in proportion to what we add
to the ideas of others from our own stores, and not to what we receive
from them. It may contain also what is to be found in other works,
but it is not that which stamps it with the character of genius. The
contrary view of the question can only tend to deter those who have
genius from using it, and to make those who are without genius, think
they have it. It is attempting to excite the mind to the highest efforts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>of intellectual excellence, by denying the chief ground-work of all
intellectual distinction. It is from the same general spirit of distrust
of the existence or power of genius that Sir Joshua exclaims with
confidence and triumph, ‘There is one precept, however, in which
I shall only be opposed by the vain, the ignorant, and the idle. I am
not afraid that I shall repeat it too often. You <span class='fss'>MUST HAVE NO
DEPENDENCE ON YOUR OWN GENIUS</span>. If you have great talents, industry
will improve them. If you have but moderate abilities, it will supply
their deficiency. Nothing is denied to well directed labour; nothing
can be obtained without it. Not to enter into metaphysical discussions
on the nature and essence of genius, I will venture to assert, that
assiduity unabated by difficulty, and a disposition eagerly directed to
the object of its pursuit, will produce effects similar to those which
some call the <em>result of natural powers</em>.’ P. 44, 45. Yet so little
influence had the metaphysical theory, which he wished to hold <i><span lang="la">in
terrorem</span></i> over the young enthusiast, on Sir Joshua’s habitual unreflecting
good sense, that he afterwards, in speaking of the attainments of Carlo
Maratti, which, as well as those of Raphael, he attributes to his
imitation of others, says, ‘It is true there is nothing very captivating
in Carlo Maratti; but this proceeded from a want which cannot be
completely supplied, that is, <em>want of strength of parts. In this, certainly,
men are not equal</em>; and a man can bring home wares only in proportion
to the capital with which he goes to market. Carlo, by diligence, made
the most of what he had: but there was undoubtedly a heaviness about
him, which extended itself uniformly to his invention, expression, his
drawing, colouring, and the general effect of his pictures. The truth
is, he never equalled any of his patterns in any one thing, and he added
little of his own.’ P. 172. Poor Carlo, it seems, then, was excluded
from the benefit of the sweeping clause in this general charter of dulness,
by which all men are declared to be equal in natural powers, and to
owe their superiority only to superior industry. What is here said
of Carlo Maratti is, however, an exact description of the fate of all
those, who, without any genius of their own, pretend to avail themselves
of the genius of others. Sir Joshua attempts to confound
genius and the want of it together, by shewing, that some men of
great genius have not disdained to borrow largely from their predecessors,
while others, who affected to be entirely original, have
really invented little of their own. This is from the purpose. If
Raphael, for instance, had only copied his figure of St. Paul from
Massacio, or his groupe, in the sacrifice of Lystra, from the ancient
bas-relief, without adding other figures of equal force and beauty, he
would have been considered as a mere plagiarist. As it is, the
pictures here referred to, would undoubtedly have displayed more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>genius, that is, more originality, if those figures had also been his
own invention. Nay, Sir Joshua himself, in giving the preference of
genius to Michael Angelo, does it on this very ground, that ‘Michael
Angelo’s works seem to proceed from his own mind entirely, and
that mind so rich and abundant, that he never needed, or seemed to
disdain to look abroad for foreign help;’ whereas, ‘Raffaelle’s
materials are generally borrowed, though the noble structure is his
own.’ On the justice of this last statement, we shall remark
presently. Perhaps Reynolds’s general account of the insignificance
of genius, and the all-sufficiency of the merits of others, may be
looked upon as an indirect apology for the gradual progress of his
own mind, in selecting and appropriating the beauties of the great
artists who went before him: he appears anxious to describe and
dignify the process, from which he himself derived such felicitous
results, but which, as a general system of instruction, can only
produce mediocrity and imbecility. It is a lesson which a well-bred
drawing-master might with great propriety repeat by rote to his
fashionable pupils, but which a learned professor, whose object was
to lead the aspiring mind to the heights of fame, ought not to have
offered to the youth of a nation. ‘You must have no dependence on
your own genius,’ is, according to Sir Joshua, the universal foundation
of all high endeavours, the beginning of all true wisdom, and the
end of all true art. Would Sir Joshua have given this advice to
Michael Angelo, or to Raphael, or to Correggio? Or would he
have given it to Rembrandt, or Rubens, or Vandyke, or Claude
Lorraine, or to our own Hogarth? Would it have been followed,
or what would have been the consequence, if it had?—That we should
never have heard of any of these personages, or only heard of them as
instances to prove that nothing great can be done without genius and
originality! We are at a loss to conceive where, upon the principle
here stated, Hogarth would have found the materials of his Marriage
a la Mode? or Rembrandt his Three Trees? or Claude Lorraine his
Enchanted Castle, with that one simple figure in the foreground,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Sole sitting by the shores of old romance?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Or from what but an eye always intent on nature, and brooding over
‘beauty, rendered still more beautiful’ by the exquisite feeling with
which it was contemplated, did he borrow his verdant landscapes and
his azure skies, the bare sight of which wafts the imagination to
Arcadian scenes, ‘thrice happy fields, and groves, and flowery vales,’
breathing perpetual youth and freshness? If Claude had gone out to
study on the banks of the Tyber with Sir Joshua’s first precept in
his mouth, ‘Individual nature produces little beauty,’ and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>returned poring over the second, which is like unto it, ‘You must
have no dependence on your own genius,’ the world would have lost
one perfect painter.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Rubens would have shared the same fate, with
all his train of fluttering Cupids, warriors and prancing steeds,
panthers and piping Bacchanals, nymphs, fawns and satyrs, if he had
not been reserved for ‘the tender mercies’ of the modern French
critics, David and his pupils, who think that the Luxembourg gallery
ought to be destroyed, to make room for their own execrable performances.
Or we should never have seen that fine landscape of his
in the Louvre, with a rainbow on one side, the whole face of nature
refreshed after the shower, and some shepherds under a group of
trees piping to their heedless flocks, if instead of painting what he
saw and what he felt to be fine, he had set himself to solve the
learned riddle proposed by Sir Joshua, whether <em>accidents in nature</em>
should be introduced in landscape, since Claude has rejected them.
It is well that genius gets the start of criticism; for if these two
great landscape painters, not being privileged to consult their own
taste and inclinations, had been compelled to wait till the rules of
criticism had decided the preference between their different styles,
instead of having both, we should have had neither. The folly of all
such comparisons consists in supposing that we are reduced to a single
alternative in our choice of excellence, and the true answer to the
question, ‘Which do you like best, Rubens’s landscapes or Claude’s?’
is the one which was given on another occasion—both. If it be
meant which of the two an artist should imitate, the answer is, the
one which he is likely to imitate best. As to Rembrandt, he would
not have stood the least chance with this new theory of art. But
the warning sounds, ‘you must have no dependence on your own
genius,’ never reached him in the little study where he watched the
dim shadows cast by his dying embers on the wall, or at other times
saw the clouds driven before the storm, or the blaze of noon-day
brightness bursting through his casement on the mysterious gloom
which surrounded him. What a pity that his old master could not
have received a friendly hint from Sir Joshua, that getting rid of his
vulgar musty prejudices, he might have set out betimes for the regions
of <i><span lang="it">virtù</span></i>, have scaled the ladder of taste, have measured the antique,
lost himself in the Vatican, and after ‘wandering through dry places,
seeking he knew not what, and finding nothing,’ have returned home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>as great a critic and painter as so many others have done! Of
Titian, Vandyke, or Correggio we shall say nothing here, as we have
said so much in another place.</p>

<p class='c007'>A theory, then, by which these great artists could have been lost
to themselves and to the art, and which explains away the two chief
supports and sources of all art, <em>nature</em> and <em>genius</em>, into an unintelligible
jargon of words, cannot be intrinsically true. The principles thus
laid down may be very proper to conduct the machinery of a royal
academy, or to precede the distribution of prizes to the students, or
to be the topics of assent and congratulation among the members
themselves at their annual exhibition dinner: but they are so far
from being calculated to foster genius or to direct its course, that
they can only blight or mislead it, wherever it exists, and ‘lose more
men of talents to this nation,’ by the dissemination of false principles,
than have been already lost to it by the want of any.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it may be said, that though the perfection of portrait or landscape
may be derived from the immediate study of nature, yet higher
subjects are not to be found in it; that there we must raise our
imaginations by referring to artificial models; and that Raphael was
compelled to go to Michael Angelo and the antique. Not to insist
that Michael Angelo himself, according to Sir Joshua’s account,
formed an exception to this rule, it has been well observed on this
statement, that what Raphael borrowed was to conceal or supply his
natural deficiencies: what he excelled in was his own. Raphael
never had the grandeur of form of Michael Angelo, nor the correctness
of form of the antique. His expression was perfectly different
from both, and perhaps better than either, certainly better than what
we have seen of Michael Angelo in the prints from him compared
with those from Raphael in the Vatican. In Raphael’s faces, particularly
his women, the expression is superior to the form; in the
antique statues, the form is evidently the principal thing. The
interest which they excite is in a manner external, it depends on a
certain grace and lightness of appearance, joined with exquisite
symmetry and refined susceptibility to voluptuous emotions, but there
is no pathos; or if there is, it is the pathos of present and physical
distress, rather than of sentiment. There is not that deep internal
interest which there is in Raphael; which broods over the suggestions
of the heart with love and fear till the tears seem ready to gush out,
but that they are checked by the deeper sentiments of hope and faith.
What has been remarked of Leonardo da Vinci, is still more true of
Raphael, that there is an angelic sweetness and tenderness in his
faces peculiarly adapted to his subjects, in which natural frailty and
passion are purified by the sanctity of religion. They answer exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to Milton’s description of the ‘human face divine.’ The ancient
statues are finer objects for the eye to contemplate: they represent a
more perfect race of physical beings, but we have no sympathy with
them. In Raphael, all our natural sensibilities are raised and refined
by pointing mysteriously to the interests of another world. The
same intensity of passion appears also to distinguish Raphael from
Michael Angelo. Michael Angelo’s forms are grander, but they are
not so full of expression. Raphael’s, however ordinary in themselves,
are full of expression even to o’erflowing: every nerve and
muscle is impregnated with feeling, or bursting with meaning. In
Michael Angelo, on the contrary, the powers of body and mind
appear superior to any events that can happen to them, the capacity
of thought and feeling is never full, never tasked or strained to the
utmost that it will bear. All is in a lofty repose and solitary
grandeur which no human interests can shake or disturb. It has
been said that Michael Angelo painted <em>man</em>, and Raphael <em>men</em>; that
the one was an epic, the other a dramatic painter. But the distinction
we have made is perhaps truer and more intelligible, <em>viz.</em> that the
former gave greater dignity of form, and the latter greater force and
refinement of expression. Michael Angelo borrowed his style from
sculpture, which represented in general only single figures, (with
subordinate accompaniments,) and had not to express the conflicting
actions and passions of a multitude of persons. He is much more
picturesque than Raphael. The whole figure of his Jeremiah droops
and hangs down like a majestic tree surcharged with showers. His
drawing of the human figure has all the characteristic freedom and
boldness of Titian’s landscapes.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To return to Sir Joshua. He has given one very strange proof
that there is no such thing as genius, namely, that ‘the degrees of
excellence which proclaims genius is different in different times and
places.’ If Sir Joshua had aimed at a confutation of himself, he
could not have done it more effectually. For what is it that makes
the difference but that which originates in a man’s self, <em>i.e.</em>, is first
done by him, is genius, and when it is no longer original, but
borrowed from former examples, it ceases to be genius, since no one
can establish this claim by following the steps of others, but by going
before them? The test of genius may be different, but the thing
itself is the same,—a power at all times to do or to invent what has
not before been done or invented. It is plain from the passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>above cited what influenced Sir Joshua’s mind in his views on this
subject. He quarrelled with genius from being annoyed with
premature pretensions to it. He was apprehensive that if genius
were allowed to stand for any thing, industry would go for nothing in
the minds of ‘the vain, the ignorant, and the idle.’ But as genius
will do little without labour in an art so mechanical as painting, so
labour will do still less without genius. Indeed, wherever there is true
genius, there will be true labour, that is, the exertion of that genius
in the field most proper for it. Sir Joshua, from his unwillingness to
admit one extreme, has fallen into the other, and has mistaken the
detection of an error for a demonstration of the truth. ‘The human
understanding,’ says Luther, ‘resembles a drunken clown on horseback;
if you set it up on one side, it tumbles over on the other.’</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'>The imitation of nature is the great object of art. Of course, the
principles by which this imitation should be regulated, form the
leading topic of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s lectures. It is certain that
the mechanical imitation of individual objects, or the parts of individual
objects, does not always produce beauty or grandeur; or,
generally speaking that <em>the whole of art does not consist in copying
nature</em>. Reynolds seems hence disposed to infer, that the whole of
art consists in <em>not</em> imitating individual nature. This is also an error,
and an error on the worst side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Joshua’s general system may be summed up in two words,—‘<em>That
the great style in painting consists in avoiding the details, and
peculiarities of particular objects</em>.’ This sweeping principle he applies
almost indiscriminately to portrait, history, and landscape;—and he
appears to have been led to the conclusion itself, from supposing the
imitation of particulars to be inconsistent with general truth and effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will not be unimportant to inquire how far this opinion is well-founded:
for it appears to us, that the highest perfection of the art
depends, not on the separation, but on the union (as far as possible)
of general truth and effect with individual distinctness and accuracy.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, it is said that the great style in painting, as it relates to the
immediate imitation of external nature, consists in avoiding the details
of particular objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>It consists neither in giving nor avoiding them, but in something
quite different from both. Any one may avoid the details. So far,
there is no difference between the Cartoons, and a common sign-painting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Greatness consists in giving the larger masses and proportions
with truth;—this does not prevent giving the smaller ones too.
The utmost grandeur of outline, and the broadest masses of light and
shade, are perfectly compatible with the greatest minuteness and
delicacy of detail, as may be seen in nature. It is not, indeed,
common to see both qualities combined in the imitations of nature,
any more than the combination of other excellences; nor are we here
saying to which the principal attention of the artist should be
directed; but we deny, that, considered in themselves, the absence
of the one quality is necessary or sufficient to the production of
the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, for example, the form of the eyebrow is correctly given, it
will be perfectly indifferent to the truth or grandeur of the design,
whether it consist of one broad mark, or is composed of a number
of hair-lines, arranged in the same order. So, if the lights and
shades are disposed in fine and large masses, the <em>breadth</em> of the
picture, as it is called, cannot possibly be affected by the filling up
of those masses with the details;—that is, with the subordinate
distinctions which appear in nature. The anatomical details in
Michael Angelo, the ever-varying outline of Raphael, the perfect
execution of the Greek statues, do not assuredly destroy their
symmetry or dignity of form;—and in the finest specimens of the
composition of colour, we may observe the largest masses combined
with the greatest variety in the parts, of which those masses are
composed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>gross</em> style consists in giving no details,—the <em>finical</em> in giving
nothing else. Nature contains both large and small parts,—both
masses and details; and the same may be said of the most perfect
works of art. The union of both kinds of excellence, of strength
with delicacy, as far as the limits of human capacity and the shortness
of human life would permit, is that which has established the
reputation of the greatest masters. Farther,—their most finished
works are their best. The predominance, however, of either excellence
in these masters, has, of course, varied according to their
opinion of the relative value of these different qualities,—the labour
they had the time or patience to bestow on their works,—the skill
of the artist, or the nature and extent of his subject. But, if the
rule here objected to,—that the careful imitation of the parts
injures the effect of the whole,—be at once admitted, slovenliness
would become another name for genius, and the most unfinished
performance would necessarily be the best. That such has been
the confused impression left on the mind by the perusal of Sir
Joshua’s discourses, is evident from the practice as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>conversation of many (even eminent) artists. The late Mr. Opie
proceeded entirely on this principle. He left many admirable
studies of portraits, particularly in what relates to the disposition
and effect of light and shade. But he never finished any of the
parts, thinking them beneath the attention of a great man. He went
over the whole head the second day as he had done the day before,
and therefore made no progress. The picture at last, having neither
the lightness of a sketch, nor the accuracy of a finished work, looked
coarse, laboured, and heavy.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Would you then have an artist finish like Denner?’ is the
triumphant appeal which is made as decisive against all objections.
To which, as it is an appeal to authority, the proper answer seems to
be,—‘No; but we would have him finish like Titian or Correggio.’
Denner is an example of finishing not to be followed, but shunned,
because <em>he did nothing but finish</em>; because he finished ill, and because
he finished to excess;—for in all things there is a certain proportion
of means to ends. He pored into the littlenesses of objects, till he
lost sight of nature, instead of imitating it. He represents the human
face, perhaps, as it might appear through a magnifying glass, but
certainly not as it ever appears to us. It is the business of painting
to express objects as they appear naturally, not as they may be made
to appear artificially. His flesh is as blooming and glossy as a flower
or a shell. Titian’s finishing, on the contrary, is equally admirable,
because it is engrafted on the most profound knowledge of effect,
and attention to the character of what he represents. His pictures
have the exact look of nature, the very tone and texture of flesh.
The endless variety of his tints is blended into the greatest simplicity.
There is a proper degree both of solidity and transparency. All
the parts hang together: every stroke tells, and adds to the effect of
the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>To understand the value of any excellence, we must refer to the
use which has been made of it, not to instances of its abuse. If
there is a certain degree of ineffectual microscopic finishing, which
we never find united with an attention to other higher and more
indispensable parts of the art, we may suspect that there is something
incompatible between them, and that the pursuit of the one diverts
the mind from the attainment of the other. But this is the real
point to stop at—where alone we should limit our theory or our
efforts. Wherever different excellences have been actually united to
a certain point of perfection, to that point (abstractedly speaking) we
are sure that they may, and ought to be united again. There is no
occasion to add the incitements of indolence, affectation, and false
theory, to the other causes which contribute to the decline of art!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Sir Joshua seems, indeed, to deny that Titian finished much, and
says that he produced, by two or three strokes of his pencil, effects
which the most laborious copyists would in vain attempt to equal.
It is true that he availed himself, in a considerable degree, of what
is called <em>execution</em>, to facilitate his imitation of nature, but it was to
facilitate, not to supersede it. By the methods of scumbling or
glazing, he often broke the masses of his flesh,—or by laying on
lumps of colour produced particular effects, to a degree that he could
not otherwise have reached without considerable loss of time. We
do not object to execution: it saves labour, and shews a mastery
both of hand and eye. But then there is nothing more distinct than
execution and <em>daubing</em>. Indeed, it is evident, that the only use of
execution is to give the details more compendiously, and sometimes,
even more happily. Leave out all regard to the details, reduce the
whole into crude unvarying masses, and it becomes totally useless;
for these can be given just as well without execution as with it.
Titian, however, made a very moderate, though a very admirable
use of this power; and those who copy his pictures will find, that
the simplicity is in the results, not in the details.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other Venetian painters made too violent a use of execution,
unless their subjects formed an excuse for them. Vandyke successfully
employed it in giving the last finishing to the details. Rembrandt
employed it still more, and with more perfect truth of effect.—Rubens
employed it equally, but not so as to produce an equal resemblance of
nature. His pencil ran away with his eye.—To conclude our
observations on this head, we will only add, that while the artist
thinks that there is any thing to be done, either to the whole or to the
parts of his picture, which can give it still more the look of nature,
if he is willing to proceed, we would not advise him to desist.—This
rule is still more necessary to the young student, for he will relax in
his attention as he grows older. And again, with respect to the
subordinate parts of a picture, there is no danger that he will bestow
a disproportionate degree of labour upon them, because he will not
feel the same interest in copying them, and because a much less
degree of accuracy will serve every purpose of deception;—the
nicety of our habitual observations being always in proportion to our
interest in the objects.—Sir Joshua somewhere objects to the attempt
to deceive by painting; and his reason is, that wax-work, which
deceives most effectually, is a very disagreeable as well as contemptible
art. It might be answered, first, that nothing is much more unlike
nature than such figures generally are, and farther, that they only
produce the appearance of prominence and relief, by having it in
reality,—in which they are just the reverse of painting.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Secondly, with regard to <span class='fss'>EXPRESSION</span>, we can hardly agree with Sir
Joshua that ‘<em>the perfection of imitation consists in giving the general idea
or character, not the peculiarities of individuals</em>.’—We do not think this
rule at all well-founded with respect to portrait-painting, nor applicable
to history to the extent to which Sir Joshua carries it. For
the present, we shall confine ourselves to the former of these.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt, if we were to chuse between the general character and
the peculiarities of feature, we ought to prefer the former. But they
are so far from being incompatible with, that they are not without
some difficulty distinguishable from, each other. There is indeed a
general look of the face, a predominant expression arising from the
correspondence and connection of the different parts, which it is
always of the first and last importance to give; and without which
no elaboration of detached parts, or marking of the peculiarity of
single features, is worth any thing; but which at the same time, is
certainly not destroyed, but assisted, by the careful finishing, and still
more by giving the exact outline of each part.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is on this point that the French and English schools differ, and
(in my opinion) are both wrong. The English seem generally to
suppose, that, if they only leave out the subordinate parts, they are
sure of the general result. The French, on the contrary, as idly
imagine, that by attending to each separate part, they must infallibly
arrive at a correct whole,—not considering that, besides the parts,
there is their relation to each other, and the general character stamped
upon them by the mind itself, which to be seen must be felt,—for it
is demonstrable that all expression and character are perceived by the
mind, and not by the eye only. The French painters see only lines,
and precise differences;—the English only general masses, and strong
effects. Hence the two nations constantly reproach one another
with the difference of their styles of art; the one as dry, hard and
minute, the other as gross, gothic, and unfinished; and they will
probably remain for ever satisfied <em>with each other’s defects</em>, which
afford a very tolerable fund of consolation on either side.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is something in the two styles, which arises, perhaps, from
national countenance as well as character:—the French physiognomy
is frittered away into a parcel of little moveable compartments and
distinct signs of intelligence,—like a telegraphic machinery. The
English countenance, on the other hand, is too apt to sink into a
lumpish mass, with very few ideas, and those set in a sort of stupid
stereotype.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to the proper business of portrait-painting. We mean to
speak of it, not as a lucrative profession, nor as an indolent amusement,
(for we interfere with no man’s profits or pleasures), but as a <em>bona fide</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>art, the object of which is to exercise the talents of the artist, and to
add to the stock of ideas in the public. And in this point of view,
we should imagine that that is the best portrait which contains the
fullest representation of individual nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Portrait-painting is the biography of the pencil, and he who gives
most of the peculiarities and details, with most of the general character,—that
is of <em>keeping</em>,—is the best biographer, and the best
portrait-painter. What if Boswell (the prince of biographers) had
not given us the scene between Wilkes and Johnson at Dilly’s table,
or had not introduced the little episode of Goldsmith strutting about
in his peach-coloured coat after the success of his play,—should we
have had a more perfect idea of the general character of those
celebrated persons from the omission of these particulars? Or if
Reynolds had not painted the former as ‘<em>blinking Sam</em>,’ or had given
us such a representation of the latter as we see of some modern poets
in some modern magazines, the fame of that painter would have been
confined to the circles of fashion,—where they naturally look for the
same selection of beauties in a portrait, as of topics in a dedication,
or a copy of complimentary verses!</p>

<p class='c007'>It has not been uncommon that portraits of this kind, which
professed to admit all the peculiarities, and to heighten all the
excellences of a face, have been elevated by ignorance and affectation,
to the dignified rank of historical portrait. But in fact they are
merely <em>caricature transposed</em>: that is, as the caricaturist makes a mouth
wider than it really is, so the painter of <em>flattering likenesses</em> (as they
are termed) makes it not so wide, by a process just as mechanical,
and more insipid. Instead, however, of objecting captiously to
common theory or practice, it will perhaps be better to state at once
our own conceptions of historical portrait. It consists, then, in
seizing the predominant form or expression, and preserving it with
truth throughout every part. It is representing the individual under
one consistent, probable, and striking view; or shewing the different
features, muscles, etc. in one action, and modified by one principle.
A face thus painted, is <em>historical</em>;—that is, it carries its own internal
evidence of truth and nature with it; and the number of individual
peculiarities, as long as they are true to nature, cannot lessen, but
must add to the general strength of the impression.</p>

<p class='c007'>To give an example or two of what we mean. We conceive that
the common portrait of Oliver Cromwell would be less valuable and
striking if the wart on the face were taken away. It corresponds
with the general roughness and knottiness of the rest of the face;—or
if considered merely as an accident, it operates as a kind of circumstantial
evidence of the genuineness of the representation. Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Joshua Reynolds’s portrait of Dr. Johnson has altogether that
sluggishness of outward appearance,—that want of quickness and
versatility,—that absorption of faculty, and look of purblind reflection,
which were characteristic of his mind. The accidental discomposure
of his wig indicates his habits. If, with the same felicity and truth
of conception, this portrait (we mean the common one reading) had
been more made out, it would not have been less historical, though it
would have been more like and natural.</p>

<p class='c007'>Titian’s portraits are the most historical that ever were painted;
and they are so for this reason, that they have most consistency of
form and expression. His portraits of Hippolito de Medici, and of a
young Neapolitan nobleman in the Louvre, are a striking contrast in
this respect. All the lines of the face in the one;—the eyebrows,
the nose, the corners of the mouth, the contour of the face,—present
the same sharp angles, the same acute, edgy, contracted expression.
The other face has the finest expansion of feature and outline, and
conveys the most exquisite idea possible of mild, thoughtful sentiment.
The harmony of the expression constitutes as great a charm in
Titian’s portraits, as that of colour. The similarity sometimes
objected to them, is partly national, and partly arises from the class
of persons whom he painted. He painted only Italians; and in his
time none but persons of the highest rank, senators or cardinals, sat
for their pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Joshua appears to have been led into several errors by a false
use of the terms <em>general</em> and <em>particular</em>. Nothing can be more
different than the various application of both these terms to different
things, and yet Sir Joshua constantly uses and reasons upon them as
invariable. There are three senses of the expression <em>general character</em>,
as applied to ideas or objects. In the first, it signifies the general
appearance or aggregate impression of the whole object, as opposed to
the mere detail of detached parts. In the second, it signifies the
class, or what a number of such objects have in common with one
another, to the exclusion of their characteristic differences. In this
sense it is tantamount to <em>abstract</em>. In the third it signifies what is
usual or common, in opposition to mere singularity, or accidental
exceptions to the ordinary course of nature. The general idea or
character of a particular face, <em>i.e.</em> the aggregate impression resulting
from all the parts combined, is surely very different from the abstract
idea, or what it has in common with several others. If on giving
the former all character depends; to give nothing but the latter is to
take away all character. The more a painter <em>comprehends</em> of what he
sees, the more valuable his work will be: but it is not true that his
excellence will be the greater, the more he <em>abstracts</em> from what he sees.—There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>is an essential distinction which Sir Joshua has not observed.
The details and peculiarities of nature are only inconsistent with
abstract ideas, and not with general or aggregate effects. By confounding
the two things, Sir Joshua excludes the peculiarities and
details not only from his historical composition, but from an enlarged
view and comprehensive imitation of individual nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have here attempted to give some account of what should be
meant by the <em>ideal</em> in portrait-painting: in our next and concluding
article on this subject, we shall attempt an explanation of this term,
as it applies to historical painting.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘For I would by no means be thought to comprehend those writers
of surprising genius, the authors of immense romances, or the modern
novel and Atalantis writers, who, without any assistance from nature
or history, record persons who never were, or will be, and facts
which never did, nor possibly can happen: whose heroes are of their
own creation, and their brains the chaos whence all their materials are
collected. Not that such writers deserve no honour; so far from it,
that perhaps they merit the highest. One may apply to them what
Balzac says of Aristotle, that they are <em>a second nature</em>; for they have
no communication with the first, by which authors of an inferior class,
who cannot stand alone, are obliged to support themselves, as with
crutches.’—<span class='sc'>Fielding’s</span> <cite>Joseph Andrews</cite>, vol. ii.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is here said of certain writers of romance, would apply
equally to a great number of painters of history. These persons, not
without the sanction of high authority, have come to the conclusion
that they had only to quit the vulgar path of truth and reality, in
order that they ‘might ascend the brightest heaven of invention,’—and
that to get rid of nature was all that was necessary to the loftiest
flights of art, as the soul disentangled from the load of matter soars to
its native skies. But this is by no means the truth. All art is built
upon nature; and the tree of knowledge lifts its branches to the
clouds, only as it has struck its roots deep into the earth. He is the
greatest artist, not who leaves the materials of nature behind him, but
who carries them with him into the world of invention;—and the
larger and more entire the masses in which he is able to apply them
to his purpose, the stronger and more durable will his productions be.
Sir Joshua Reynolds admits that the knowledge of the individual
forms and various combinations of nature, is necessary to the student,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>but it is only in order that he may <em>avoid</em> them, and steering clear of
all representation of things as they actually exist, wander up and down
in the empty void of his own imagination, having nothing better to
cling to, than certain shadowy middle forms, made up of an abstraction
of all others, and containing nothing in themselves. Stripping
nature of substance and accident, he is to exhibit a decompounded,
disembodied, vague, ideal nature in her stead, seen through the misty
veil of metaphysics, and covered with the same fog and haze of
confusion, while</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The concrete, and not the abstract, is the object of painting, and
of all the works of imagination. History-painting is <em>imaginary</em>
portrait-painting. The portrait-painter gives you an individual, such
as he is in himself, and vouches for the truth of the likeness as a
matter of fact: the historical painter gives you the individual such as
he is likely to be,—that is, approaches as near to the reality as his
imagination will enable him to do, leaving out such particulars as are
inconsistent with the preconceived idea,—as are merely trifling and
accidental,—and retaining all such as are striking, probable, and
consistent. Because the historical painter has not the same immediate
data to go upon, but must connect individual nature with an imaginary
subject, is that any reason why he should discard individual nature
altogether, and thus leave nothing for his imagination, or the imagination
of the spectator to work upon? Portrait and history differ as a
narration of facts or a probable fiction differ; but abstraction is the
essence of neither. That is not the finest historical head which has
least the look of nature, but which has most the look of nature, if it
has the look of history also. But it has the look of nature, <em>i.e.</em> of
striking and probable nature,—as it has a marked and decided
character, and not a character of indifference: and as the features
and expression are consistent with themselves, not as they are
common to others. The ideal is that which answers to the idea of
something, and not to the idea of any thing, or of nothing. Any
countenance strikes most upon the imagination, either in a picture or in
reality, which has most distinctness from others, and most identity
with itself. The keeping in the character, not the want of character,
is the essence of history. Without some such limitation as we have
here given, on the general statement of Sir Joshua, we see no resting-place
where the painter or the poet is to make his stand, so as not to
be pushed to the utmost verge of naked common-place inanity,—nor do
we understand how there should be any such thing as poetry or painting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>tolerated. A <em>tabula rasa</em>, a verbal definition, the bare name, must be
better than the most striking description or representation;—the
argument of a poem better than the poem itself,—or the catalogue of
a picture than the original work. Where shall we stop in the easy
down-hill pass of effeminate, unmeaning insipidity? There is one
circumstance, to be sure, to recommend the system here objected to,
which is, that he who proposes this ideal perfection to himself, can
hardly fail to succeed in it. An artist who paints on the infallible
principle of not imitating nature, in representing the meeting of
Telemachus and Calypso, will not find it difficult to confound all
difference of sex or passion, and in pourtraying the form of Mentor,
will leave out every distinctive mark of age or wisdom. In representing
a Grecian marriage he will refine on his favourite principles
till it will be possible to transpose the features of the bridegroom and
the bride without the least violation of propriety; all the women will
be like the men; and all like one another, all equally young, blooming,
smiling, elegant, and insipid. On Sir Joshua’s theory of the <i><span lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i>,
Mr. Westall’s pictures are perhaps the best that ever were painted, and
on any other theory, the worst; for they exhibit an absolute negation
of all expression, character, and discrimination of form and colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall endeavour to explain our doctrine by some examples
which appear to us either directly subversive of, or not very obviously
included in, Sir J. Reynolds’s theory of history painting, or of the
principles of art in general. Is there any one who can possibly
doubt that Hogarth’s pictures are perfectly and essentially <em>historical</em>?—or
that they convey a story perfectly intelligibly, with faces and
expressions which every one must recognise? They have evidently
a common or general character, but that general character is defined
and modified by individual peculiarities, which certainly do not take
away from the illusion or the effect any more than they would in
nature. There is, in the polling for votes, a fat and a lean lawyer,
yet both of them are lawyers, and lawyers busy at an election
squabble. It is the same with the voters, who are of all descriptions,
the lame, the blind, and the halt, yet who all convey the very feeling
which the scene inspires, with the greatest variety and the
greatest consistency of expression. The character of <cite>Mr. Abraham
Adams</cite> by Fielding, is somewhat particular, and even singular: yet it
is not less intelligible or striking on that account; and his lawyer and
his landlady, though copied from individuals in real life, had yet, as
he himself observes, existed four thousand years, and would continue
to make a figure in the world as long as certain passions were found
united with certain situations, and operating on certain dispositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will, we suppose, be objected that this, though history and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>invention, is not high history, or poetical invention. We would
answer then at once by appealing to Shakespeare. It will be allowed
that his characters are poetical as well as natural; yet the individual
portrait is almost as striking as the general expression of nature and
passion. It is this and this only which distinguishes him from the
French school. Dr. Johnson, proceeding on the same theoretical
principles as his friend Sir Joshua, affirms, that the excellence of
Shakespeare’s characters consists in their generality. We grant in
one sense it does; but we will add that it consists in their particularity
also. Are the admirable descriptions of the kings of
Thrace and Inde in Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale, less poetical or
historical, or ideal, because they are distinguished by traits as
characteristic as they are striking;—in their lineaments, their persons,
their armour, their other attributes, the one black and broad, the other
tall, and fair, and freckled, with yellow crisped locks that glittered as
the sun. The four white bulls, and the lions which accompany them
are equally fine, but they are not fine because they present no distinct
image to the mind. The effect of this is somehow lost in Dryden’s
Palamon and Arcite, and the poetry is lost with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much more is it necessary to combine individuality with the highest
works of art in painting, ‘whose end and use both at the first, now is,
and was, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature.’ The painter
gives the degree and peculiarity of expression where words in a
manner leave off, and if he does not go beyond mere abstraction, he does
nothing. The cartoons of Raphael, and his pictures in the Vatican,
are sufficiently historical, yet there is hardly a face or figure in any of
them which is anything more than fine and individual nature finely
disposed. The late Mr. Barry, who could not be suspected of a prejudice
on this side of the question, speaks thus of them,—‘In
Raphael’s pictures (at the Vatican) of the Dispute of the Sacrament
and the School of Athens, one sees all the heads to be entirely
copied from particular characters in nature, nearly proper for the
persons and situation which he adapts them to; and he seems to me
only to add and take away what may answer his purpose in little parts,
features, &#38;c.: conceiving, while he had the head before him, ideal
characters and expressions, which he adapts these features and
peculiarities of face to. This attention to the particulars which distinguish
all the different faces, persons and characters, the one from
the other, gives his pictures quite the verity and unaffected dignity
of nature, which stamp the distinguishing differences betwixt one man’s
face and body and another’s.’</p>

<p class='c007'>If any thing is wanting to the conclusiveness of this testimony, it is
only to look at the pictures themselves, particularly the Miracle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the Conversion, and the Assembly of Saints, which are little else
than a collection of divine portraits, in natural and expressive
attitudes,—full of the loftiest thought and feeling, and as varied as
they are fine. It is this reliance on the power of nature, which has
produced those master-pieces by the prince of painters, in which
expression is all in all;—where one spirit—that of truth—pervades
every part, brings down heaven to earth, mingles cardinals and popes
with angels and apostles, and yet blends and harmonises the whole by
the true touches and intense feeling of what is beautiful and grand in
nature. It is no wonder that Sir Joshua, when he first saw Raphael’s
pictures in the Vatican, was at a loss to discover any great excellence
in them, if he was looking out for his theory of the ideal, of neutral
character and middle forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another authority, which has been in some measure discovered
since the publication of Sir Joshua’s Discourses, is to be found in
the Elgin Marbles, taken from the Acropolis, and supposed to be the
works of the celebrated Phidias. The process of fastidious refinement,
and flimsy abstraction, is certainly not visible there. The
figures have all the ease, the simplicity, and variety of nature, and
look more like living men turned to stone than any thing else.
Even the details of the subordinate parts, the loose folds in the skin,
the veins under the belly or on the sides of the horses, more or less
swelled as the animal is more or less in action, are given with
scrupulous exactness. This is true nature, and true history. In a
word, we can illustrate our position here better than we could with
respect to painting, by saying that these invaluable remains of
antiquity are precisely like casts taken from nature.—Michael Angelo
and the antique may still be cited against us, and we wish to speak
on this subject with great diffidence. We confess, they appear to us
much more artificial than the others, but we do not think that this is
their excellence. For instance, it strikes us that there is something
theatrical in the air of the <cite>Apollo</cite>, and in the <cite>Hercules</cite> an ostentatious
and over-laboured display of the knowledge of the muscles. Perhaps
the fragment of the <cite>Theseus</cite> at Lord Elgin’s has more grandeur as
well as more nature than either of them. The form of the limbs, as
affected by pressure or action, and the general sway of the body, are
better preserved in it. The several parts in the later Greek statues
are more balanced, made more to tally like modern periods; each
muscle is more equally brought out, and highly finished, and is
so far better in itself, but worse as a part of a whole. If these
wonderful productions have a fault, it is the want of simplicity, of a
due subordination of parts, which sometimes gives them more a look
of perfect lay-figures put into attitudes, than of real imitations of nature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>The same objection may be urged against the works of Michael
Angelo, and is indeed the necessary consequence either of selecting
from a number of different models, or of proceeding on a scientific
knowledge of the structure of the different parts; for the physical
form is something given and defined, but motion is various and infinite.
The superior symmetry of form, common to the ancient statues, we
have no hesitation in attributing to the superior symmetry of the
models in nature, and to the superior opportunity for studying them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, we would be understood to mean, that the ideal is not a
voluntary fiction of the brain, a fanciful piece of patch-work, a compromise
between the defects of nature, or an artificial balance struck
between innumerable deformities, (as if we could form a perfect idea
of beauty though we never had seen any such thing,) but a preference
of what is fine in nature to what is less so. There is nothing fine in
art but what is taken almost immediately and entirely from what is
finer in nature. Where there have been the finest models in nature,
there have also been the finest works of art. The Greek statues were
copied from Greek forms. Their portraits of individuals were often
superior to their personifications of their gods; the head of the
<cite>Antinous</cite>, for example, to that of the <cite>Apollo</cite>. Raphael’s expressions
were taken from Italian faces; and we have heard it observed, that
the women in the streets of Rome seem to have walked out of his
pictures in the Vatican.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we are asked, then, what it is that constitutes historic expression
or ideal beauty, we should answer, not (with Sir Joshua) abstract
expression or middle forms, but consistency of expression in the one,
and symmetry of form in the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>A face is historical, which is made up of consistent parts, let those
parts be ever so peculiar or uncommon. Those details or peculiarities
only are inadmissible in history, which do not arise out of any
principle, or tend to any conclusion,—which are merely casual, insignificant,
and unconnected,—which do not <em>tell</em>; that is, which either do
not add to, or which contradict the general result,—which are not
integrant parts of one whole, however strange or irregular that whole
may be. That history does not require or consist in the middle form
or central features is proved by this, that the antique heads of fauns
and satyrs, of <cite>Pan</cite> or <cite>Silenus</cite>, are perfectly grotesque and singular; yet
are as undoubtedly historical, as the Apollo or the Venus, because
they have the same predominant, intelligible, characteristic expression
throughout. <cite>Socrates</cite> is a person whom we recognise quite as familiarly,
from our general acquaintance with human nature, as <cite>Alcibiades</cite>.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>The simplicity or the fewness of the parts of a head facilitates this
effect, but is not necessary to it. The head of a negro, a mulatto, &#38;c.
introduced into a picture is always historical, because it is always
distinct from the rest, and uniform with itself. The face covered with
a beard is historical for the same reason, because it presents distinct
and uniform masses. Again, a face, not so in itself, becomes historical
by the mere force of passion. The same strong passion moulds the
features into the same emphatic expression, by giving to the mouth, the
eyes, the forehead, etc., the same expansion or contraction, the same
voluptuous movement or painful constraint. All intellectual and impassioned
faces are historical;—the heads of philosophers, poets,
lovers, and madmen. Passion sometimes produces beauty by this
means, and there is a beauty of form, the effect entirely of expression;
as a smiling mouth, not beautiful in common, becomes so by being put
into that action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Joshua was probably led to his opinions on art in general by his
theory of beauty, which he makes to consist in a certain central form,
the medium of all others. In the first place, this theory is questionable
in itself: or if it were not so, it does not include many other
things of much more importance in historical painting (though perhaps
not so in sculpture<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a>) namely, character, which necessarily implies
individuality; expression, which is the excess of thought or feeling,
strength or grandeur of form, which is excess also.—There seems,
however, to be a certain symmetry of form, as there is a certain
harmony of sounds or colours, which gives pleasure, and produces
beauty, independently of custom. Custom is undoubtedly one source
or condition of beauty, but it appears to be rather its limit than its
essence; that is, there are certain given forms and proportions
established by nature in the structure of each thing, and sanctioned by
custom, without which there can only be distortion and incongruity,
but which alone do not produce beauty. One kind is more beautiful
than another; and the objects of the same kind are not beautiful
merely as we are used to them. The rose or lily is more beautiful
than the daisy, the swan than the crow, the greyhound than the beagle,
the deer than the wild goat; and we invariably prefer the Greek to
the African face, though our own inclines more to the latter. We
admire the broad forehead, the straight nose, the small mouth,
the oval chin. Regular features are those which record and assimilate
most to one another. The Greek face is made up of smooth flowing
lines, and correspondent features; the African face of sharp angles
and projections. A row of pillars is beautiful for the same reason.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>We confess, on this subject of beauty, we are half-disposed to fall into
the mysticism of Raphael Mengs, who had some notion about a
principle of <em>universal harmony</em>, if we did not dread the censure of an
eminent critic.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seldom happens that the same family produces an emperour and
an epic poet. So it is, however, in the present instance. The
brother of Buonaparte may be allowed to take his rank among poets,
as Buonaparte himself has done among kings. But the historian of
Charlemagne does not appear to us to present quite the same formidable
front to the established possessors of the seats of the muses, as the
imitator of Charlemagne did to the hereditary occupiers of thrones. A
self-will without controul, an ambition without bounds, a gigantic
daring which built its confidence of success on the contempt of danger,
were the means by which Buonaparte obtained and lost his portentous
power; and by which he would probably have lost it on the borders
of the Ganges, or among the sands of the Red Sea, if he had not been
prevented by the snows of Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our poet is not the same monster of genius that his brother was of
power. In the career of fame, he does not risk the success of his
reputation by the unlimited extravagance of his pretensions. His
muse does not disdain to borrow the conceptions of others, or to submit
to the rules of art; and the boldest flights of his imagination seldom
pass the bounds of a well-regulated enthusiasm. <cite>Charlemagne</cite> is the
work of a very clever man, rather than a great poet; it displays more
talent than genius, more ingenuity than invention. It is more artificial
than original. In saying this, we would not be understood to mean,
that it is without considerable novelty, either of description or sentiment.
Far, very far from it: almost every page presents examples of
both, equally striking and elegant, which it would be difficult to refer
immediately to any similar passages in other authors. But the whole
wants character: it does not bear the stamp of the same presiding
mind: no new world of imagination is opened to the view: we do not
feel the presence of a power which we have never felt before, and
which we can never forget.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stanzas are all equally or proportionably good: but they are as
good separately, as taken together: they do not run into one another;
they do not make a poem. There is no strong impulse given, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>overpowering grandeur of effect. In scarcely any part of the story
does the mind look back with terror and delight at what is past, or
hurry on with eager curiosity to what is to come. The art is too
apparent. The author is too busy in managing his materials, in
selecting, adorning, varying, and amplifying them to the best advantage:
but they seem something external to him. His subject has not taken
entire possession of his mind, and therefore he does not take full
possession of his readers. Yet it is certain that all the materials of
poetry are here;—imagery, incident, character, passion, thought, and
observation—all but the divine enthusiasm of the poet, which can
alone communicate true warmth and enthusiasm to others.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one praise which we most willingly bestow on this poem,
which is, that it is not <em>French</em>. It is not another <span class='sc'>Henriade</span>:—that
is, it is not poetry devoid of all imagination, and of every thing
like imagination. On the contrary, it abounds with variety and
distinctness of conception, and is evidently written on the model of
Italian poetry. We were a little surprised to find that the author had
not adopted the common heroic French verse, but has borrowed the
Italian Stanza with varying rhymes, and a little half verse in the
middle, which has an agreeable effect enough in the lighter parts of
the poem, but does not accord so well with the more serious and impressive.
The following stanzas will give our readers an idea of the
metre, and of the general style of description.—They represent
Charlemagne traversing the Alps the night before a battle.</p>

<p class='c007'>We might refer to many other passages equally picturesque, though
perhaps to none so poetical. Such as the comparison of Roland
taken from the scene of combat by Oliver, to a lion led off by an
African, that still roars as he follows his well-known guide;—the
first appearance of Armelie, the death of Wilfred at the altar, the
vanishing of Adelard from the sight of Charlemagne, the forest of
Eresbourg, the Druidical sacrifice, and the funeral rites of Orlando
in the valley of Ronscevalles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The language of the poem often bears a striking resemblance to
the language of painting, or seems like a detailed description of some
<i><span lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i> of the art, rather than the creation of the poet’s fancy.
We should have little doubt that the solitary church in the valley of
Ronscevalles is copied from that in the back-ground of Titian’s
<cite>St. Peter Martyr</cite>, and the massacre at the altar in the first canto is
certainly taken from some picture of Raphael!</p>

<p class='c007'>In the sentiments of this poem there is more feebleness, a greater
number of Gallicisms, than in the imagery. We meet with such
courtly expressions as these:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<span lang="fr">Les Francs à chaque instant voient de nouveaux guerriers</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr"><em>Solliciter l’honneur d’embrasser leur defense</em>!</span>’</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>The devil addresses the deity with the following piece of high-flown
sentimentality:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<span lang="fr">Pour braver les remords, et la gêne et la flamme,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Je ne demande rien <em>qu’un seul rayon d’espoir</em>.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We know, indeed, from whence the allusion is taken, and we
wonder the more at the affectation implied in the alteration. It is
like some of Pope’s refinements on Isaiah. In giving an account of
the sorrow which prevails in heaven at the disasters of the church of
Christ, the author has expressed a trite theological sentiment with
more felicity than we recollect to have seen it expressed before:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The conception of his Heaven is much more just than that of
Hell, though the execution is (almost as a matter of course) less
powerful. The two figures of Adam and Moses, in the former, are
particularly fine:</p>

      <div class='line in2'>‘<span lang="fr">Le père des humains voit sa nombreuse race,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Our poet has, very good-naturedly, (and we hope with the
approbation of his holiness the Pope, to whom this work is dedicated,)
set aside two stanzas for the secret conveyance of the souls of
virtuous heathens and of little children, into the abodes of the blest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author of <cite>Charlemagne</cite> has constructed his hell upon an entirely
new and fanciful theory. We see no sort of reason why Satan
should not, in strict propriety, sit upon a throne; nor why his
followers should be degraded from the rank of fallen angels into
modern French revolutionists. We like Milton’s account much
better in all respects; and our author himself, as is the natural
consequence of all affectation, flounders into contradiction in the very
next verse, where he gives a most superb account of Lucifer. In
the same spirit, he has made a more enlightened distribution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>crimes and punishments; and established an entire new set of regulations
and bye-laws in the regions of the damned. Alexander and
the two Brutuses figure there with Cain and other murderers, while
‘the noble Cæsar’ is exempted. Now we have no notion of such a
philosophical hell as our poetical casuist would carve out. This
celebrated place is, we think, of all others the least liable to plans of
reform. It is almost the oldest establishment upon record, and
placed quite out of the reach of the progress of reason and metaphysics.
We hate disputes in poetry, still more than in religion.
At least, whatever appeals to the imagination, ought to rest on
undivided sentiment, on one undisputed tradition, one catholic faith.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c009'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
Besides, the whole account of the infernal regions is an excrescence,
equally misplaced and improbable. None of the heroes of the poem
descend there, but as Satan is brought thence to appear to Charlemagne
in the shape of a lying priest, this opportunity is taken to describe the
geography of the place according to the latest discoveries. There is
one point in which we agree with the poet, <em>viz.</em> in his indignation
against tyrants and their flatterers, though he does not go so far as
honest Quevedo, who, when his hero wonders to see so few kings in
hell, makes his guide reply sullenly, ‘Here are all that ever reigned.’</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall conclude our remarks on this part of the poem with the
author’s description of the punishment of Cain, which we think the
most striking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of a poem is seldom worth a long description. It may be
sufficient to say in the present case, that the danger to which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>church was exposed, and from which it was afterwards delivered,
arose from the second marriage of <cite>Charlemagne</cite> with <em>Armelie</em>, the
daughter of <em>Didier</em>, the King of the Lombards, who was exerting
himself to depose Pope Adrian. Charlemagne had divorced his first
wife, <em>Adelinde</em>, but he is warned in a vision to take her again to his
bosom. He does so, and <em>Didier</em> and his daughter consequently
become the enemies of this Christian Emperor, who takes arms to
defend the Holy See. After the usual casualties and fluctuations of
fortune, the son of Pepin finally triumphs.</p>

<p class='c007'>On a more careful examination, we see no reason to alter our first
opinion of this poem. It has given us no strong impulse, nor left any
permanent trace on our minds. It opens no new and rich vein of
poetry, though certainly great talents are shewn in the use which is
made of existing materials. Perhaps it may be said that this is all
that can be done in a modern poem: if so, that <em>all</em> is hardly worth
the doing. There is no one who has borrowed his materials more
than Milton, or who has made them more completely his own: there
is hardly a line which does not breathe the same lofty spirit, hardly
a thought or image which he has not clothed with the majesty of his
genius. It is the same in reading other great poets. The informing
mind is every where present to us. Who is there that does not
know and feel sensibly the majestic copiousness of Homer, the
polished elegance of Virgil, enamoured of its own workmanship,—the
severe grandeur of Dante, the tender pathos of Tasso, the endless
voluptuousness of Spenser, and the unnumbered graces of Ariosto?
Even the mysterious solemnity of Ossian, and the wild romantic
interest of Walter Scott, are something gained to the imagination.
But in the present instance, we do not feel the same participation
with the author’s mind, nor accession of strength to our own. So
little is it in the power even of the most accomplished art to counterfeit
nature. The true Florimel did not differ more from the Florimel
which was made for the witches’ son, than true genius from the most
successful and elaborate imitation of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall close these remarks with extracting two passages which
in the opinion of our readers will perhaps be thought to amount to a
complete refutation of our objections. The first is the description of
the funeral rites of Orlando, in the thirteenth canto.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have been able to obtain access to the almost inaccessible collection
of the Prince of Canino. The liberality with which the collections
of foreign princes are thrown open to strangers and the public is often
boasted of; but this liberality, we suppose, ceases when the same
collections are exposed in this country for sale. The pictures of
Lucien Buonaparte, which are valued at £40,000, are kept in most
‘vile durance’; and even the ticket of admission, which we presented
to a person who seems placed at the door to keep persons out, and
not to let them in, was inspected and objected to with the same
scrupulous jealousy as if it had been a bank-note presented in payment
of the purchase-money of the collection. A cursory glance round
the room was sufficient to explain the source of so much mystery and
caution. The pictures are in general mere trash. Nor is the general
dearth of attraction relieved by even a few examples of first-rate
excellence. The only exception to these remarks which struck us
was an exquisite female head by Leonardo da Vinci. It is one of
the finest specimens we have seen of that great master, both for
expression, drawing, the spirit and delicacy of the execution, and the
preservation of the tone of colouring. There is in Leonardo’s female
heads a grace and charm of expression, which is peculiar to himself—a
character of natural sweetness and playful tenderness, mixed up
with the pride of conscious intellect, and with the graceful reserve of
personal dignity. He blends purity with voluptuousness; and the
expression of his women is equally characteristic of ‘the mistress or
the saint!’ His pictures are always worked up to the utmost height
of the idea he had conceived, with an elaborate felicity. No painter
made more a religion of his art! His fault is, that his style of
execution is too mathematical; that is, his pencil does not follow the
graceful variety of nature, but substitutes certain refined gradations
both of form and colour, producing equal changes in equal distances,
with a mechanical uniformity. Leonardo was a man of profound
learning as well as genius; and perhaps transferred too much of the
formality of science to his favourite art. In making this objection,
we have had in our eye two of the most celebrated pictures, the
<cite>Jocunda</cite> in the Louvre, and the <cite>St. John</cite> in the possession of Mr.
Hope. The picture in the present collection has more flexibility and
variety; as well as greater heightening of colour; and perhaps the
latter effect may be the cause of the former. It is not impossible
that a certain degree of monotony may have been sometimes produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>by the rubbing off of the higher tints and finishing touches of the
pencil, so as to leave little more of the picture than the general
ground-work.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to the collection before us. The only remaining pictures
which can excite any interest are, some curious specimens of the early
masters, Ghirlandaio, Bellino, and others;—some small sketches of
Titian; a finely coloured Holy Family by the same master; a portrait
by Sebastian del Piombo; a sketch of Diana and Acteon, by A.
Caracci; a landscape by Ruysdael; and a transfiguration, said to be
by Vasari. Besides these, there is a Frenchified Salvator Rosa,
coloured pink and blue, a copy of Domenichino’s head of St. Jerome,
one or two pretended Claudes, and some <em>amatory</em> pictures of the
modern French school. To these shall we add the picture of Lucien
Buonaparte himself? Nothing certainly can go beyond it in its way.
It is the very <em>priggism</em> of portrait-painting.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already said something of the French style of portraits,
and we shall here add a few remarks in explanation, though we are
aware that any hints of a want of refinement will be thrown away on
a nation so entirely <em>spirituel</em> as the French, and we are also afraid
that some of our own artists may take credit to themselves for as
many excellences, as we may charge their neighbours with defects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French systematically paint all objects as they would paint
<em>still life</em>; and hence they in general never paint any thing <em>but still
life</em>. It is not possible to paint that which has life and motion
by the same mechanical process by which that which has neither life
nor motion may be represented. Thus it is not possible to imitate the
human countenance, which is moveable and animated, as you would
imitate a piece of drapery, or a chair, or a table, in which the physical
appearance is every thing, and that appearance always remains the
same. The industry of the eye and hand will go a great way in giving
the effect of a number of parts of any external object, arranged in the
same order; but to give truth of effect to that which is always
varying, and always expressive of more than strikes the senses, imagination
and feeling are absolutely required. Whenever there is life
and motion, life and motion become the principal things; and any
attempt to give these, without a distinct operation or feeling of the
mind as to what constitutes their essence, by a mere attention to the
physical form, or particular details, must necessarily destroy all
appearance both of one and the other. To instance in expression
only. This can only be given by being felt. Take for instance the
outline of part of a face, and let it be so placed as to form part of the
outline of a rock, or any other inanimate object. A copy of this,
done with tolerable care, will seem to be the same thing: but let it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>be known that this is really a part of a human countenance, and then
it will probably be found to be quite different <em>from the difference of
expression</em>. We distinguish all objects more or less by habitual knowledge;
and this knowledge is always acute in proportion to the interest
excited, that is, to the intensity of the feeling or passion which is
combined with the immediate impression on the senses. Expression
is therefore only caught by sympathy; and it has been received as a
maxim, that no painter can succeed in giving an expression which is
totally foreign to his own character. There are some painters who
cannot paint a wise man, and others who cannot paint a fool: some
who cannot give strength, and others softness to their works. It is
the want of character, of flexibility, and transient expression, which
is the great defect of French portraits. Without the indications of
the mind breathed into the countenance and moulding the features, the
whole must appear stiff, hard, mean, unconnected, and lifeless—like
the mask of a face, not like the face itself—forced, affected, and
unnatural. Another consequence of this mode of copying the letter
and leaving out the spirit of all objects, is that the face in general looks
the least finished part of the picture, for while the other parts remain
the same, this necessarily varies, and the only way to make up for the
want of literal exactness, must be by seizing the force and animation
of the expression. A head that does not look like life, cannot look
like any thing else.—The portrait of Lucien Buonaparte is a striking
confirmation of these remarks. We do not know how to describe it
otherwise than by saying that it looks as if the artist had first modelled
the face in wax, oiled it over, painted the lips purple, stuck on a pair
of artificial eyebrows, and inserted a pair of dark blue glass eyes,
and then set to work to copy every part of this perverse misrepresentation,
with tedious and disgusting accuracy. In a portrait of
the author of Charlemagne, one has a right to expect some refinement
of intellect and feeling, if not the marks of elevated genius.
No such thing. The picture has just the appearance of a spruce
holiday mechanic, with all the hardness, littleness, and vulgarity of
expression which is to be found in nature, where the countenance
has not been expanded by thought and sentiment, and in art, where
this expression has been entirely overlooked. The French artists
themselves, both men and women, seem to be aware of the dilemma
to which they are reduced, and prefer copying from plaster casts, or
lay figures, to painting from the life; which baffles the mechanical
minuteness and ‘laborious foolery’ of their style of art. They set
about painting a face as they would about engraving a picture. This
cannot possibly answer. From the general idea of the liveliness and
volatility of the French character one would be apt to suppose, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>instead of the method here described, their artists would have adopted
the happier mode proposed by Pope in describing his characters of
women:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Come, then, the colours and the ground prepare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chuse a firm cloud, before it falls, and in it</div>
      <div class='line'>Catch, ere the change, the Cynthia of a minute!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But the days of Watteau are over, and the plodding gravity of the
Dutch has succeeded to the natural levity of French art. It is no
wonder: for both proceed from a want of real concentration and force
of intellect.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c009'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is another picture in this collection which we would recommend
to the attention of all <em>whom it may concern</em>, as a most instructive
lesson of the vanity of human pretensions, and the capriciousness of
national taste. It is the historical picture of the return of Marcus
Sextus, by Guerin, one of the most admired painters of the modern
French school. This picture combines all the vices of that school
in their most confirmed and aggravated state, and yet it drew, at the
time when it was first exhibited in Paris, crowds of admirers, whose
raptures were excited exactly in proportion as it flattered their
habitual prejudices, and outraged every principle of common sense.
It consists of three figures, that of the husband standing in front of
the bed, the wife who lies dead upon it being behind him, and the
daughter kneeling at his feet. Now all these figures seem as if they
had been cut out of pasteboard, smeared over with putty to represent
the shadows, and then stuck flat against the canvass to make a picture.
This is not truth, nor invention, nor art, nor nature: but it is the
French style of painting. Their pictures are sections of statues, or
architectural elevations of the human figure. They have the effect
neither of painting nor sculpture; for painting has colour, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>appearance of substance, sculpture has real substance without colour;
but these have neither colour, substance, nor the appearance of it, but
consist of mere lines. Whatever they may do, we cannot think this
the highest style of history: because proceeding on arithmetical
principles only, it wants two out of three of the physical requisites of
the art of painting. The picture of Guerin is painted in strong contrast
of light and shade, and ought to have proportionable prominence
and relief. But from the habit of attending only to lines and detached
parts, that is, of never combining the lesser masses into larger ones,
or of contemplating the general appearance of nature, the whole effect
is frittered away, and neither the prominent parts stand out, nor do
the receding ones fall back. The same flat, imbecile, and dingy
effect is produced, as by smearing white streaks upon a black ground,
without knowledge or design, or reference to any actual object in
nature. The drawing in this picture is equally characteristic of the
general French style, and equally repulsive. It is not easy to explain
the elaborate absurdity of the process: but it is in reality this. The
painter has taken the figure of an antique statue for the figure of his hero.
But finding that the position would not answer his purpose; he
therefore gets a lay-figure made from a cast of this statue, and distorting
it into the attitude he wants, places it against some object
which props it up, with the two feet stretched out before it, as if it
could neither move nor stand; and this the artist calls painting
history, and copying the ancients. This is what no other nation dare
attempt. The expression which is given to these mockeries of art
and nature, is of a piece with the rest. It is either copied tamely,
servilely, and without effect, from the model before them, or if any
thing is added to it, all grace and feeling is instantly lost in the
extravagance of grimace and affectation. The ambition of these
refiners on nature is like that of Pygmalion to give life and animation
to a stone, but no miracle has yet come to their assistance.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The
French are incapable of painting true history, for they are a people
essentially without imagination, and without a knowledge of the
passions that belong to it. All that is powerful in them, is immediate
sensation—the rest is either levity, or formality, or distortion.
Take the picture of the deluge by Girodet. In this, a daughter is
represented clinging to her mother by the hair of her head, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>mother is clinging to the husband, he is at the same time supporting
his father with his other arm, and is enabled to support the whole of
this exquisite family groupe by taking hold of the branch of a tree
which has just broken off by the weight. This effort of imagination
almost equals the exploit of the clown in the pantomime, who contrives
to balance a dozen men on one another’s shoulders. If Poussin or
Raphael had been fortunate enough to study in the central schools
of Paris, what a difference would this new principle of grouping have
introduced into their pictures of the Deluge and the Incendio del
Borgo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we quit this subject of French art, we would notice that
there are two pictures of the Emperor Napoleon to be seen at present,
one in Leicester-fields, which is very bad, and another in the Adelphi,
by Lefebre, which is tolerably good. The last is one of the best
French portraits we have ever seen. The effect however is only
good, very near, and is best when each part is seen through a magnifying
glass. There is considerable character, firmness of drawing,
and prominence in the features. Still it does not convey an adequate
idea of the man. It is heavy, perplexed, and sullen, without sufficient
fierceness or energy, and indeed without either the high or the bad
qualities of the original. It has, notwithstanding, the appearance of
being what is understood by a faithful likeness, and only wants that
full developement of the workings of the mind, which every portrait
ought to have, and which, in a portrait like the present, would be
invaluable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Exhibition of this year, which opens to the public on Monday,
is said to be inferior to the last:—that was said to be inferior to the
one before it,—that to the preceding one, and so on. This is the
common cant respecting all Exhibitions; and the reason is obvious
enough. We are naturally less struck by pictures of the same degree
and class of excellence, by the same artists, on repetition than at first
sight; and the art appears to be retrograde, only because it is not
progressive. Perhaps, however, there is some foundation for the
objection in the present instance. At least, we think there is a
falling off in the historical department: though that is the department
of the art which would least bear any kind of retrenchment.
We do not know whether to lay the blame of the deficiency on those
artists, who have been away this summer on their visit to the French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>capital, or on those who have remained behind. The picture in this
branch of the art which pleased us the most on looking into it, and
which we conceive has decidedly the greatest number of excellent
parts, though the general effect is very far from striking, is ‘<cite>Brutus
exhorting the Romans to revenge the Death of Lucretia</cite>,’ by C. L.
Eastlake. The artist will excuse us, if we say that we think the
principal figure, that of <em>Brutus</em>, by much the worst part of the picture.
A more theatrical, and less impressive figure we have seldom seen.
He is quite an orator of the modern stamp, and has nothing of the
‘antique Roman’ about him. He is not a bit better than any of
the blustering, canting, vapid, Canning school, and is evidently an
orator to be disposed of. We would advise Mr. Eastlake to take a
hint from a high quarter, and get rid of him, at any rate. The effect
of the attitude of this figure, which is represented pointing with a
sword to the body of <em>Lucretia</em>, behind him, is almost entirely lost by
the want of distinct foreshortening and prominent relief.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c009'><sup>[25]</sup></a> The figure
of <em>Brutus</em> seems in a line with that of <em>Lucretia</em>. Indeed, the same
defect pervades the whole picture, which is laid-in like mosaic, and the
general pale, stone-colour appearance of the drapery, and of the flesh,
adds to this effect. No one figure comes out before the rest to the
eye, till by tracing it down to the feet, you find where it stands. The
dead figure of <em>Lucretia</em> herself is a complete piece of marble. We
wish to notice more particularly, because it is an excellence very rare
in an English artist, that the attention to costume in the decorations
of the bier on which the dead body lies, and in the other ornaments
in the back-ground of the picture, gives an additional air of truth and
consequently of interest to the scene. The peculiar merit of this
composition is the great variety of distinct faces and characteristic
expressions to be found in it. These, if not of a very high order,
are at least much better than the pompous nonentities to which we
are accustomed. There is very little of passion or emotion given or
attempted, but we think the expression of attention in the surrounding
audience is varied very happily, and with great truth of nature. The
most picturesque and interesting part of the picture is the groupe in
which a girl with a back-figure is supporting (we suppose) the mother
of <em>Lucretia</em>. The expression of the countenance in the latter reminded
us of Annibal Caracci, and we are always glad to be reminded of him.
Certainly the same effect was not produced upon our minds by the
boy in the foreground, with sandy hair and weak eyes, who is crying
so piteously: still less did we like the figure of a man in the right
hand corner, who is explaining the story to another with his fists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>clenched, and in a boxing attitude. The model for a Roman warrior
is as little to be sought in a Fives Court, as of a Roman patriot
in a debating society, or even (with leave be it spoken) in an English
House of Commons. We have dwelt the longer on this picture,
because its immediate effect on the eye is by no means in proportion
to its real merit. The drab-coloured quakerism of the tone conceals
it from observation almost as much as if it had a veil over it. We
do not really understand the object of these sickly half-tints, which
all French artists, and some of our own, affect. Nicolas Poussin,
who had no relief of light and shade, had strong contrasts of colour:
or even if he had had neither, the great distinctness of his outline,
and his striking manner of telling the story, might still have formed a
sufficient excuse for him. In short, the style of colouring adopted
in this picture may, for aught we know, accord very well with some
more artificial and recondite style of historical composition; but we
are sure, it has nothing to do with natural expression, or immediate
effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said, that ‘a great book is a great evil.’ We think
the same thing might be applied to pictures: or at least we should
not instance the large picture in this collection of <cite>The Burial of our
Lord</cite>, by C. Coventry, as an exception to the rule. We admit,
however, that the face, dress, and figure of the old man holding the
drapery over Christ, are picturesque, and in the fine manner of
Rembrandt. The attitude and action of this figure are exactly the
same as those of a similar figure in Mr. Bird’s picture of the same
subject. This is rather a singular coincidence in two pictures
exhibited at the same time, and which it is therefore improbable to
suppose could have been copied one from the other. The other
figures about Christ we cannot bring ourselves to admire: they
resemble painted wood. The colour of the Christ is a livid purple,
the worst of all possible colours. The women are better; though
the fine turn in the waist of one of them is not in the best style of
history, which does not profess to exhibit women of fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bird’s picture of <cite>The Entombment of Christ</cite>, is, we conceive,
very inferior to his picture last year of <cite>Job and his Friends</cite>. The
colouring is equally bad, and the composition is not equally good.
There is one pretty figure of a girl, but her prettiness is not an
advantage to the subject. In all things, ‘It is place which lessens
and sets off.’ Mr. Bird constantly introduces the extremities of the
hands and feet into his pictures, only to show how ill he can paint
them. The picture of <cite>The Surrender of Calais</cite> has been already
before the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the historical pictures, we suppose from its name, we must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>rank that of the <cite>Prophet Ezra</cite>, by G. Hayter, though it does not
appear to us to belong to the class. It is a fine, rich, and strongly
painted picture of a man reading a book. The being able to copy
nature with truth and effect is not history, though we think it is the
first step to it. In this picture, which we believe is a first essay,
Mr. Hayter has not redeemed the pledge he gave in his miniatures.
If we could paint such miniatures as he does, we would do nothing
but paint miniatures always; and laugh at the advertisements of great
historical pictures in the newspapers. The <cite>St. Bernard</cite>, by the
same artist, is very indifferent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Harlowe’s <cite>Hubert and Arthur</cite> is the greatest piece of coxcombry
and absurdity we remember to have seen. We do not think
that any one who pleases has a right to paint a libel on Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c007'>The generality of the historical pictures in the gallery are such as
have been always painted, and as will always be painted, in spite of
all that can be said to the contrary, and therefore it is as well to say
nothing about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Jackson’s <cite>Mars subdued by Peace</cite> is a very pleasing composition.
Both the face and expression of the figure of <em>Peace</em> are those
of a very beautiful and interesting girl, though from the tender
pensiveness of the features she seems rather as if sending <em>Mars</em> out to
battle than disarming him; and as to the God of War himself, he
does not look like one whom ‘deep scars of thunder have intrenched,’
but as if he had been kept a long time at home in a lady’s chamber.
The Cupids (when Ladies imagine Cupids, what can they be less?)
are very nice, little, chubby fellows.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two pictures of <cite>The Sick Pigeon</cite> and <cite>The Favourite
Kitten</cite> by Miss Geddes, both of which we like, gallantry out of the
question. The kitten in the last is exquisitely painted. You may
almost hear it <em>purring</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the foreign contributors to this department we ought to
mention <cite>Music</cite>, by M. Messora, in the manner of the early Italian
masters, and <cite>Devotion</cite>, a small picture by J. Laschallas, which is hung
almost out of sight, and which, if it were hung a little lower, we
suspect, would be found to be ‘a good picture and a true.’</p>

<p class='c007'>To the scene from the <cite>Marriage of Figaro</cite>, by Chalon, no praise
of ours could add the slightest grace or lustre. We wonder where
he got the figure of his <em>Susan</em>, or how he dared to paint her!</p>

<p class='c007'>In the domestic scenes, and views of interiors, &#38;c. this exhibition
is much like the former ones, except that we miss Collins, and find
no one to replace him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the landscapes, Burnett’s, Fielding’s, Nasmyth’s, Hofland’s,
and Glover’s are the best. In Mr. Glover’s large picture of <cite>Jacob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>and Laban</cite> (which we believe was exhibited and much admired in
Paris), there is a want of harmony and lightness in the whole: but
there is a groupe of trees in the foreground, which Claude himself
would not have disdained to borrow. Mr. Hofland’s landscapes,
without being much finished, have the look, the tone, and freshness
of nature. The <cite>View of Edinburgh</cite> is, we think, the best. Some
of the others are too much abstractions of aerial perspective: they
are naked and cold, and represent not the objects of nature so much
as the medium through which they are seen. We will only add, in
our professional capacity, that this gentleman’s pictures shew themselves,
and that he need not be at the trouble of shewing them.
Nasmyth’s pictures are not too much finished, but they want a certain
breadth, which nature always adds to perfect finishing. Fielding is
a new and most promising artist, of whom we mean to say more.
Of the two Burnetts, we shall only remark at present, that they
have made no addition to their live-stock since last year, which
consisted then, as it does now, of one black, one yellow, and one
spotted cow.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>A Scolding Wife; her Husband having spent all his Money at the
Fair</cite>, L. Cossé. This is not a very pleasant subject, nor very
pleasantly treated. The little child blowing the trumpet is the pretty
part of the picture. There is one figure of a woman in a blue stuff
gown, sitting by the fire-side, in an attitude of yawning, which both
for the truth of the colouring and the action, is inimitable.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>A Country Scene</cite>, by the same, has the hard brickdusty tone which
there is in the faces of the other picture; but the expression is
natural and good.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span><cite>A Colour-Grinder</cite>, R. T. Bone, is a spirited and faithful imitation
of nature.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>A Study from Nature</cite>, J. Harrison, is a well-painted head. At
the same time, there is something about it very unpleasant to us.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Hebe</cite> and <cite>Sunrise</cite>, by H. Howard, R.A., were, we believe, in last
year’s Exhibition at Somerset-house. There is a certain grace and
elegance in both of them. The fantastic, playful lightness of the
figures in the last is perhaps carried to a degree of affectation. The
faces of the Pleiades are very pretty and very insipid.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Conrade and Gulnare</cite>, H. Singleton. We could neither understand
this picture nor the lines from Lord Byron’s <cite>Corsair</cite>, which are
intended to explain the subject of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Brutus exhorting the Romans to revenge the Death of Lucretia.</cite> Of
this composition we find we have already said quite enough.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>View of Arthur’s Seat near Edinburgh</cite>, P. Nasmyth, is a very nicely
painted landscape. We like all this gentleman’s landscapes, except
<cite>A View of Edinburgh</cite>, which is just like a painting on a tea-board.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Breaking the Ice</cite>, by James Burnett, is a very delightful picture. It
has the effect of walking out in a fine winter’s morning. Many
incidental associations are very happily introduced; the pigeons
collected on the thatch of a shed, and the robin-redbreast perched
in a window of an out house. The pigeons are, however, too small,
and the colour on the breast of the robin is on fire. Perhaps these
objections are too minute. The pigeon-house looks suspended in the
air, and the sky and branches of the trees seen against it are painted
with admirable brilliancy. <cite>Peasants going to Market</cite>, by the same
artist, is of equal merit. The skirt of the drapery of the peasant
girl looks as if the sun shone directly upon it. The docks in the
foreground of the picture are very highly finished, and touched with
great spirit, but we never saw this kind of plant of the lightish green
colour, which is here given to it.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Milking</cite>, by John Burnett, is a very brilliant little picture. The
red dress of the girl at the milk-pail is as rich as possible. The trees
at a little distance are too much in sharp points and touches. The
cattle in the landscapes of both the painters of this name are too much
in heavy masses, and form too violent a contrast to the lightness of
the landscape about them.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Watering Place</cite>, P. H. Rogers, deserves considerable praise,
both for the colouring and composition.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Banks of the Thames</cite>, J. Wilson, is a very clever picture. The
foreground and the distance are equally well painted; but they do
not appear in keeping. The one is quite clear, and the other
covered with haze.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span><cite>Morning</cite>, and <cite>View from Rydal Woods</cite>, by C. V. Fielding, are
both masterly performances. The last, in particular, is a rich, mellow
landscape, and presents a fine, woody, and romantic scene, which in
some degree calls off our admiration from the merit of the artist to
the beauties of nature. This is a sacrifice of self-love which many
of our artists do not seem willing to make. They too often chuse
their subjects, not to exhibit the charms of nature, but to display
their own skill in making something of the most barren subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>We think this objection applies to Mr. Hofland’s landscapes in
general. The scene he selects is represented with great truth and
felicity of pencil, but it is, generally speaking, one we should neither
wish to look at, nor to be in. In his <cite>Loch-Lomond</cite> and <cite>Stirling
Castle</cite>, the effect of the atmosphere is finely given; but this is all.
We wish to enter our protest against this principle of separating <em>the
imitation</em> from <em>the thing imitated</em>, particularly as it is countenanced by
the authority of the ablest landscape painter of the present day, of
whose landscapes some one said, that ‘they were pictures of nothing,
and very like!’</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Battle-piece</cite>, B. Barker, is a spirited sketch, harmoniously coloured.
In force of drawing and expression, it is inferior to <cite>The Standard</cite>, by
Ab. Cooper. There is too violent an opposition of white and black
in the horses in this picture; and the eye does not immediately
connect the heads of the animals with the rest of their bodies. This
picture, however, displays great knowledge of the subject, and
considerable strength of composition. <cite>A Study from Nature</cite>, by the
same artist, Ab. Cooper, is a masterly little picture. <cite>Birds</cite>, from
nature, and <cite>Plovers</cite>, from nature, by M. Chantry, are both excellent
in their kind.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>View of Richmond, Yorkshire</cite>, by W. Westall, A.R.A. is deficient
in perspective and in other respects. The river below seems to be
on a level with the high foreground from which it is seen. The
representing declivities by means of aerial perspective is, we believe,
one of the difficulties of the art, and we do not remember any successful
instances of it, except in some of Wilson’s landscapes.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>A Boy lamenting the Death of his Favourite Rabbit</cite>, W. Davison,
is a very pleasing composition in the style of Gainsborough. The
landscape has too much the blue greenish hue and slender execution
of Gainsborough’s back-grounds. The boy is well painted. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>is a picture of this kind by Murillo in the collection at Dulwich,
which we would earnestly recommend to every painter of such
subjects. Or we might as well, in other words, recommend them
to look at nature.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Forest Scene</cite>, by J. Stark, is painted with great truth of colour and
effect.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Stacking Hay</cite>, P. Dewint, has great merit.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Jacob taking charge of the Flocks and Herds of Laban</cite>, J. Glover.
We have already spoken of this picture. The group of tall green
trees in the foreground is excellent, but there is a leaden tone spread
over the rest of the picture, which is neither gratifying to the eye,
nor true to nature.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Emperor Alexander, in his Droschi</cite>, by A. Sauerweide, is like
all the other pictures, busts, &#38;c. we have seen of him, and not at

a good picture; but it gives one a good idea of the sport which is to

<p class='c007'>In one of Archbishop Herring’s letters, written during a tour in
Wales, is the following very picturesque description of a scene at an
inn. ‘I set out upon this adventurous journey on a Monday morning,
accompanied (as bishops usually are) by my chancellor, my chaplain,
secretary, two or three friends, and our servants. The first part of
our road lay across the foot of a long ridge of rocks, and was over
a dreary morass, with here and there a small dark cottage, a few
sheep and more goats in view, but not a bird to be seen, save, now
and then, a solitary hern, watching for frogs. At the end of four of
their miles, we got to a small village, where the view of things
mended a little, and the road and the time were beguiled by travelling
for three miles along the side of a fine lake, full of fish, and transparent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>as glass. That pleasure over, our work became very arduous,
for we were to mount a rock, and in many places of the road, over
natural stairs of stone. I submitted to this, which, they told me,
was but a taste of the country, and to prepare me for worse things to
come. However, worse things did not come that morning, for we
dined soon after out of our own wallets; and though our inn stood in
a place of the most frightful solitude, and the best formed for the
habitation of monks (who once possessed it) in the world, yet we
made a cheerful meal. The novelty of the thing gave me spirits, and
the air gave me appetite, much keener than the knife I ate with. We
had our music too; for there came in a harper, who soon drew about
us a group of figures, that Hogarth would give any price for. The
harper was in his true place and attitude; a man and a woman stood
before him, singing to his instrument wildly, but not disagreeably;
a little dirty child was playing with the bottom of the harp; a woman,
in a sick night-cap, hanging over the stairs; a boy with crutches,
fixed in a staring attention, and a girl carding wool in the chimney,
and rocking a cradle with her naked feet, interrupted in her business
by the charms of the music; all ragged and dirty, and all silently
attentive. These figures gave us a most entertaining picture, and
would please you, or any man of observation; and one reflection gave
me particular comfort, that the assembly before us demonstrated, that,
even here, the influential sun warmed poor mortals, and inspired them
with love and music.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The figures in this description form a very striking group, and we
should like much to see them transferred to the canvass. Those of
the girl with naked feet rocking the cradle, the little child playing
with the bottom of the harp, and the man and woman singing wildly
before it are the most beautiful. There is one observation made by
the writer to which we do not assent, that the figures are such as
Hogarth would have given any price for. We doubt whether he
would have meddled with them at all, for there was no one who
understood his own powers better, or more seldom went out of his
way. His <em>forte</em> was satire, he painted the follies or vices of men,
and we do not know that there is a single picture of his, containing
a representation of merely natural or domestic scenery. The subject
described in the passage we have given above would have exactly
suited an excellent painter of the present day, we mean Mr. Wilkie;
and would indeed form a very delightful companion to his Blind
Fiddler. With all our admiration of this last-mentioned composition,
we think the story described by the bishop clearly has the poetry on
its side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The highest authority on art in this country, we understand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>has pronounced that Mr. Wilkie united the excellences of Hogarth
to those of Teniers. We demur to this decision, in both its
branches; but in demurring to authority, it is necessary to give our
reasons. We conceive that this excellent and deservedly admired
artist has certain essential, real, and indisputable excellences of his
own; and we think it, therefore, the less important to clothe him
with any vicarious merits, which do not belong to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wilkie’s pictures, generally speaking, derive almost their
whole merit from their <em>reality</em>, or the truth of the representation.
They are works of pure imitative art, and the test of this style of
composition is to represent nature, faithfully and happily, in its
simplest combinations. It may be said of an artist, like Mr. Wilkie,
that <em>nothing human is indifferent to him</em>. His mind takes an interest in,
and it gives an interest to, the most familiar scenes and transactions
of life. He professedly gives character, thought, and passion in their
lowest degrees, and every-day forms. He selects the commonest
events and appearances of nature for his subjects; and trusts to their
very commonness for the interest and amusement he is to excite. Mr.
Wilkie is a serious, prosaic, literal narrator of facts, and his pictures
may be considered as diaries, or minutes of what is passing constantly
about us. Hogarth, on the contrary, is essentially a comic painter;
his pictures are not indifferent, unimpassioned descriptions of human
nature, but rich, exuberant satires upon it. He is carried away by a
passion for the <em>ridiculous</em>. His object is ‘to shew vice her own
feature, scorn her own image.’ He is so far from contenting himself
with still life, that he is always on the verge of caricature, though
without ever falling into it. He does not represent folly or vice in
its incipient, or dormant, or <em>grub</em> state, but full grown, with wings,
pampered into all sorts of affectation, airy, ostentatious, and extravagant.
Folly is there seen at the height—the moon is at the full—it
is ‘the very error of the time.’ There is a perpetual collision of
eccentricities—a tilt and tournament of absurdities—the prejudices
and caprices of mankind are let loose, and set together by the ears, as
in a bear-garden. Hogarth paints nothing but comedy, or tragicomedy.
Wilkie paints neither one nor the other. Hogarth never
looks at any object but to find out a moral or a ludicrous effect.
Wilkie never looks at any object but to see that it is there.
Hogarth’s pictures are a perfect jest-book from one end to the other.
We do not remember a single joke in Wilkie’s, except one very bad
one of the boy in The Blind Fiddler, scraping the gridiron, or fire-shovel,
we forget which.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c009'><sup>[26]</sup></a> In looking at Hogarth, you are ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>burst your sides with laughing at the unaccountable jumble of odd
things, which are brought together: you look at Wilkie’s pictures
with a mingled feeling of curiosity and admiration at the accuracy of
the representation. For instance, there is a most admirable head of a
man coughing in The Rent-Day: the action, the keeping, the
choaked sensation are inimitable: but there is nothing to laugh at in
a man coughing. What strikes the mind is the difficulty of a man’s
being painted coughing, which here certainly is a master-piece of art.
But turn to the blackguard cobler in the Election Dinner, who has
been smutting his neighbour’s face over, and who is lolling his tongue
out at the joke with a most surprising obliquity of vision, and
immediately ‘your lungs begin to crow like chanticleer.’ Again,
there is the little boy crying in The Cut Finger, who only gives you
the idea of a cross, disagreeable, obstinate child in pain: whereas
the same face in Hogarth’s Noon, from the ridiculous perplexity it is
in, and its extravagant, noisy, unfelt distress at the accident of having
let fall the pye-dish, is quite irresistible. Mr. Wilkie in his picture
of the Ale-house door, we believe, painted Mr. Liston as one of the
figures, without any great effect. Hogarth would have given any
price for such a subject, and would have made it worth any money.
We have never seen any thing, in the expression of comic humour,
equal to Hogarth’s pictures, but Liston’s face!</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already remarked that we did not think Hogarth a fit
person to paint a romantic scene in Wales. In fact, we know no
one who had a less pastoral imagination. Mr. Wilkie paints interiors:
but still you always connect them with the country. Hogarth, even
when he paints people in the open air, represents them either as
coming from London, as in the polling for votes at Brentford, or as
returning to it, as the dyer and his wife at Bagnigge Wells. In this
last picture he has contrived to convert a common rural image into
a type and emblem of city cuckoldom. He delights in the thick
of St. Giles’s or St. James’s. His pictures breathe a certain close
greasy tavern air. The fare he serves up to us consists of high-seasoned
dishes, ragouts and olla podridas, like the supper in Gil Blas,
which it requires a strong stomach to digest. Mr. Wilkie presents
us with a sort of lenten fare, very good and wholesome, but rather
insipid than overpowering.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c009'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As an artist, Mr. Wilkie is not at all equal to Teniers. Neither
in truth and brilliant clearness of colouring, nor in facility of execution,
is there any comparison. Teniers was a perfect master in both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>these respects, and our own countryman is positively defective, notwithstanding
the very laudable care with which he finishes every part
of his pictures. There is an evident smear and dragging of the paint,
which is also of a bad purple, or puttyish tone, and which never
appear in the pictures of the Flemish artist, any more than in a
looking-glass. Teniers, probably from his facility of execution,
succeeded in giving a more local and momentary expression to his
figures. They seem each going on with his particular amusement or
occupation; while Wilkie’s have in general more a look of sitting for
their pictures. Their compositions are very different also: and in
this respect, perhaps, Mr. Wilkie has the advantage. Teniers’s
boors are usually amusing themselves at skittles, or dancing, or
drinking, or smoking, or doing what they like in a careless desultory
way; and so the composition is loose and irregular. Wilkie’s figures
are all drawn up in a regular order, and engaged in one principal
action, with occasional episodes. The story of the Blind Fiddler is
the most interesting, and the best told. The two children before the
musician are delightful. The Card-players is the best coloured of
his pictures, if we are not mistaken. The Politicians, though
excellent as to character and composition, is inferior as a picture to
those which Mr. Wilkie has since painted. His latest pictures,
however, do not appear to us to be his best. There is something of
manner and affectation in the grouping of the figures, and a pink and
rosy colour spread over them, which is out of place. The hues of
Rubens and Sir Joshua do not agree with Mr. Wilkie’s subjects.
The picture which he has just finished of Distraining for Rent is
very highly spoken of by those who have seen it. We must here
conclude this very general account; for to point out the particular
beauties of any one of our artist’s pictures, would require a long
article by itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The celebrated maxims of Rochefoucault contain a good deal of
truth mixed up with more falsehood. They might in general be
easily reversed. The whole artifice of the author consists in availing
himself of the <em>mixed</em> nature of motives, so as to detect some indirect
or sinister bias even in the best, and he then proceeds to argue as if
they were <em>simple</em>, that is, had but one principle, and that principle the
worst. By the same extreme mode of reasoning which he adopts,
that is, by taking the exception for the rule, it might be shewn that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>there is no such thing as selfishness, pride, vanity, revenge, envy, &#38;c.
in our nature, with quite as much plausibility as he has attempted to
shew that there is no such thing as love, friendship, gratitude,
generosity, or true benevolence. If the slightest associated circumstance,
or latent impulse connected with our actions, is to be magnified
into the whole motive, merely by the microscopic acuteness which
discovered it, why not complete the paradox, by resolving our vices
into some pretence to virtue, which almost always accompanies and
qualifies them? Or is it to be taken for granted that our vices are
sincere, and our virtues only hypocrisy and affectation? Shakespeare
has given a much simpler and better account of the matter, when he
says, ‘The web of our life is of a mingled yarn: our virtues would be
proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our vices would despair,
if they were not cherished by our virtues.’ The most favourable
representations of human nature are not certainly the most popular.
The character of <em>Sir Charles Grandison</em> is insipid compared with that
of <em>Lovelace</em>, as <em>Satan</em> is the hero of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>; and Mandeville’s
<cite>Fable of the Bees</cite> is read with more interest and avidity than the
<cite>Practice of Piety</cite> or Grove’s <cite>Ethics</cite>. Whatever deviates from the
plain path of duty, or contradicts received opinions, seems to imply a
strength of will, or a strength of understanding, which seizes forcibly
on the attention. Whether it is fortitude or cowardice, or both,
there is a strong propensity in the human mind, if its suspicions are
once raised, <em>to know the worst</em>. It is the same in speculation as in
practice. When once the fairy dream in which we have lulled our
senses or imagination is disturbed, we only feel ourselves secure from
the delusions of self-love by distrusting appearances altogether, and
revenge ourselves for the cheat which we think has been put upon us,
by laughing at the credulity of those who are still its dupes.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c009'><sup>[28]</sup></a> Even
the very love of virtue makes the mind proportionably impatient of
every thing like doubt respecting it, and prompts us to escape from
tormenting suspense in total indifference, as jealousy cures itself by
destroying its object. The <cite>Fable of the Bees</cite>, the <cite>Maxims of Rochefoucault</cite>,
the <cite>Treatise on the Falsity of Human Virtues</cite>, and the book
<cite>De l’Esprit</cite> have owed much of their popularity to the consolation
they afforded to disappointed hope. However this may be, a collection
of amiable paradoxes on the other side of the question, would
have but few readers. There would be less point and satire, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>there would not be less truth nor, as far as the analytical process is
concerned, less ingenuity, in exalting our bad qualities into virtues,
than in debasing our good ones into vices. I will give an example or
two of what I mean.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, it might be argued that there is no such thing as envy: or
that what is called by that name, does not (if strictly examined)
arise from a hatred of real excellence, but from a suspicion that the
excellence is not real, or not so great as it is supposed to be, and
consequently that the preference given to others is an act of injustice
done to ourselves. For whenever all doubt is removed of the reality of
the excellence, either from our own convictions, or from the concurrent
opinion of mankind in general, envy ceases. This is the
reason why the reputation of the dead never excites this passion,
because it has been fully established by the most unequivocal
testimony, it has received a sanction which fills the imagination and
gains the assent at once, and the fame of the great men of past times
is placed beyond the reach of envy, because it is placed beyond the
reach of doubt. We feel no misgivings as to the solidity of their
pretensions, nor any apprehension that our admiration or praise will
be thrown away on what does not deserve it. No one envies Shakespeare
or Rubens, because no one entertains the least doubt of their
genius. We are as prodigal of our admiration of universally acknowledged
excellence, making a sort of religious idolatry of it, as we are
niggardly and cautious in fixing the stamp of our approbation on that
which may turn out to be only counterfeit. It is not because we are
competitors with the living and not with the dead: but because the
claims of the one are fully established, and of the other not. Why
else indeed are we competitors with the one and not with the other?
Accordingly, where living merit is so clear as to bring immediate
and entire conviction to the mind, we are no longer disposed to stint
or withhold our applause, any more than to dispute the light of the
sun. For instance, who ever felt the least difficulty in acknowledging
the merits of Wilkie or Turner, merely because these artists are now
living? If immediate celebrity has not always been the reward of
extraordinary genius, this has been owing to the incapacity of the
public to judge of the highest works of art. There is no want of
instances where the popular opinion has outstripped the claims of
justice, whenever the merits of the artist were on a level with the
common understanding, and of an obvious character. Sir Joshua
Reynolds had his full share of popularity in his lifetime. Raphael
Mengs was cried up by his countrymen and contemporaries as equal
to Raphael; and Mr. West at present stands as high in the estimation
of the public as he does in his own. On the other hand, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>opposition to what was said above (though the exception still confirms
the rule), the French hate Shakespeare and Rubens, for no other
reason than because there is nothing in their minds which really
enables them to understand or relish either. The admiration which
they hear others express of this great painter and greater poet, appears
to them a delusion, an instance of false taste, and a bigoted preference
of that which is full of faults to that—<em>which is without beauties</em>.
The disputes and jealousies of different nations respecting each other’s
productions, arise chiefly from this source. We despise French
painting, French poetry, and French philosophy, not because they
are French, but because they appear to us to want the essential
requisites of genius, feeling, and common sense. We do not feel
any reluctance to admire Titian or Rembrandt, or Phidias or
Homer, or Boccace or Cervantes, merely because they were not
English. They speak the universal language of truth and nature.
Our national and local prejudices for the most part operate only as a
barrier against national and local absurdities. To the same purpose,
I might mention some modern poets and critics who are actuated by
nearly as intolerant feelings towards Pope and Dryden, as if they had
been their contemporaries.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c009'><sup>[29]</sup></a> They are not their cotemporaries, but
the explanation is obvious. From the want of congeniality of mind,
and a taste for their peculiar excellencies, the space which those
writers occupy in the eyes of the world seems comparatively disproportionate
to their merits; and hence the irritation and gall which
follows. The highest reputation and the highest excellence almost
always destroy envy; whereas, on the common supposition, we
ought to feel the greatest envy, where there is the greatest superiority,
and the greatest admiration of it in others. If we never become
entirely free from it in modern works, it is because with respect to
them we can never ‘make assurance double sure,’ by having our own
feelings confirmed by the united voices of ages and nations. True
genius and true fame seize our admiration, and our admiration, when
once excited, becomes a passion, and we take a delight in exaggerating
the excellences of our idol as if they were our own. On the contrary,
we all envy that reputation which is acquired by trick or cunning, or
by mere shewy accomplishments, as when with moderate talents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>dexterously applied, or an appeal to ignorant credulity, a man ‘gets
the start of the majestic world,’ and obtains the highest character for
qualities which he does not possess. It becomes an imposture and an
insult, which we resent as such.</p>

<p class='c007'>The jealousy and uneasiness produced in the mind by a pedantic or
dazzling display of useless accomplishments may be traced to a similar
source. Hence the old objection, <i><span lang="la">materiam superabat opus</span></i>. True
warmth and vigour communicate warmth and vigour: and we are no
longer inclined to dispute the inspiration of the oracle, when we feel
the ‘presens Divus’ in our own bosoms. But when without gaining
any new light or heat, we only find our ideas thrown into confusion
and perplexity by an art that we cannot comprehend, this is a kind
of superiority which must always be painful, and can never be cordially
admitted. It is for this reason that the extraordinary talents of the
late Mr. Pitt were always viewed, except by those of his own party,
with a sort of jealousy, and grudgingly acknowledged: while those of
his more popular rivals were admitted by all parties in the most
unreserved manner, and carried by acclamation. Mr. Burke was
scouted only by the common herd of politicians, who did not understand
him. So on the stage, we imagine Mrs. Siddons could hardly
have excited envy or jealousy in the breast of any person, not totally
devoid of common sensibility: because her talents bore down all
opposition, and filled the mind at once with delight and awe. Mr.
Kean has a strong and most absurd party against him: but we will
venture to say that if his figure, or his voice, or his judgment, were
better, that is, if he had fewer defects, he would have fewer detractors
from his excellencies. Any peculiar defects excite ridicule and
enmity by bringing the whole claim to our applause into question.
A perfect actor would not be an object of envy even to some newspaper
critics. Perfect beauty excites this feeling less among women
than half pretensions to it. In the same manner, upstart wealth or
newly acquired honours produce contempt rather than respect, from
not being accompanied with any strong or permanent associations of
pleasure or power. There is nothing more apt to occasion the
feeling of envy than the sudden and unexpected rise of persons we
have long known under different circumstances, not from the
immediate comparison with ourselves (the extravagant admiration of
each other’s talents among friends is an answer to this supposition) so
much as from the disbelief of the reality of their pretensions, and our
inability to overcome our previous prejudice against them. It is the
same where striking mental inequalities exist, or where the moral
properties render us averse to acknowledge merit of a different kind,
or where the countenance or manner does not denote genius. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>such incongruity increases the difficulty of connecting hearty admiration
with ideas so opposite to it. I have known artists whose
physiognomy was so much against them, that no one would ever
think highly of them, though they were to paint like Raphael; and
I once heard a very sensible man say, that if Sir Isaac Newton had
lisped, he could not have fancied him to be a great man. I myself
have felt a jealousy of pretensions which I thought inferior to my
own, but I never knew what envy of great talents was. I do not
indeed like to be put down by persons I despise, or to seem to
myself less than nothing. In a word, we feel the same jealousy and
irritation at seeing others surpassed, whom we have been accustomed
to admire; and what is more, grow jealous of our own approximation
to an equality with them. Every ingenuous mind shrinks from a
comparison of itself, with what it looks up to, and is ashamed of any
advantage it may gain over those whom it regards as having higher
powers and pretensions. The idea of fame is too pure and sacred to
be mingled with our own. Our admiration of others is stronger than
our vanity. Poor indeed is that mind which has no other idol but
self. It is the want of all real imagination and enthusiasm, or that
little glittering halo of personal conceit which surrounds every
Frenchman, and does not suffer him to see or feel any thing beyond
it, that makes the French perhaps the most contemptible people in
the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Anthony Codrus Urceus, a most learned and unfortunate Italian,
born 1446, was a striking instance’ (says his biographer) ‘of the
miseries men bring upon themselves by setting their affections unreasonably
on trifles. This learned man lived at Forli, and had an
apartment in the palace. His room was so very dark, that he was
forced to use a candle in the day time; and one day, going abroad
without putting it out, his library was set on fire, and some papers
which he had prepared for the press were burned. The instant he
was informed of this ill news, he was affected even to madness. He
ran furiously to the palace, and, stopping at the door of his apartment,
he cried aloud, “Christ Jesus! what mighty crime have I committed?
whom of your followers have I ever injured, that you thus rage with
inexpiable hatred against me?” Then turning himself to an image
of the Virgin Mary near at hand, “Virgin” (says he) “hear what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>I have to say, for I speak in earnest, and with a composed spirit. If
I shall happen to address you in my dying moments, I humbly entreat
you not to hear me, nor receive me into heaven, for I am determined
to spend all eternity in hell.” Those who heard these blasphemous
expressions endeavoured to comfort him, but all to no purpose; for,
the society of mankind being no longer supportable to him, he left
the city, and retired, like a savage, to the deep solitude of a wood.
Some say he was murdered there by ruffians; others that he died
at Bologna, in 1500, after much contrition and penitence.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost every one may here read the history of his own life.
There is scarcely a moment in which we are not in some degree
guilty of the same kind of absurdity, which was here carried to such
a singular excess. We waste our regrets on what cannot be recalled,
or fix our desires on what we know cannot be attained. Every hour
is the slave of the last; and we are seldom masters either of our
thoughts or of our actions. We are the creatures of imagination,
passion, and self-will, more than of reason or even of self-interest.
Rousseau, in his Emilius, proposed to educate a perfectly reasonable
man, who was to have passions and affections like other men, but with
an absolute control over them. He was to love and to be wise. This
is a contradiction in terms. Even in the common transactions and
daily intercourse of life, we are governed by whim, caprice, prejudice,
or accident. The falling of a tea-cup puts us out of temper for the
day; and a quarrel that commenced about the pattern of a gown may
end only with our lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are little better than humoured children to the last, and play a
mischievous game at cross-purposes with our own happiness and that
of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have given the above story as a striking contradiction to the
prevailing doctrine of modern systems of morals and metaphysics,
that man is purely a sensual and selfish animal, governed solely by a
regard either to his immediate gratification or future interest. This
doctrine we mean to oppose with all our might, whenever we meet
with it. We are, however, less disposed to quarrel with it, as it is
opposed to reason and philosophy, than as it interferes with common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>sense and observation. If the absurdity in question had been confined
to the schools, we should not have gone out of our way to meddle
with it: but it has got abroad in the world, has crept into ladies’
toilettes, is entered in the common-place of beaux, is in the mouth of
the learned and ignorant, and forms a part of popular opinion. It is
perpetually applied as a false measure to the characters and conduct
of men in the common affairs of the world, and it is therefore our
business to rectify it if we can. In fact, whoever sets out on the
idea of reducing all our motives and actions to a simple principle,
must either take a very narrow and superficial view of human nature,
or make a very perverse use of his understanding in reasoning on what
he sees. The frame of our minds, like that of our bodies, is
exceedingly complicated. Besides mere sensibility to pleasure and
pain, there are other original independent principles, necessarily interwoven
with the nature of man as an active and intelligent being, and
which, blended together in different proportions, give their form and
colour to our lives. Without some other essential faculties, such as
will, imagination, &#38;c., to give effect and direction to our physical
sensibility, this faculty could be of no possible use or influence; and
with those other faculties joined to it, this pretended instinct of self-love
will be subject to be everlastingly modified and controlled by
those faculties, both in what regards our own good and that of others;
that is, must itself become in a great measure dependent on the very
instruments it uses. The two most predominant principles in the
mind, besides sensibility and self-interest, are imagination and self-will,
or (in general) the love of strong excitement, both in thought
and action. To these sources may be traced the various passions,
pursuits, habits, affections, follies and caprices, virtues and vices of
mankind. We shall confine ourselves in the present article, to give
some account of the influence exercised by the imagination over the
feelings. To an intellectual being, it cannot be altogether arbitrary
what ideas it shall have, whether pleasurable or painful. Our ideas
do not originate in our love of pleasure, and they cannot therefore
depend absolutely upon it. They have another principle. If the
imagination were ‘the servile slave’ of our self-love, if our ideas were
emanations of our sensitive nature, encouraged if agreeable, and
excluded the instant they became otherwise, or encroached on the
former principle, then there might be a tolerable pretence for the
Epicurean philosophy which is here spoken of. But for any such
entire and mechanical subserviency of the operations of the one
principle to the dictates of the other, there is not the slightest foundation
in reality. The attention which the mind gives to its ideas is
not always owing to the gratification derived from them, but to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>strength and truth of the impressions themselves, <em>i.e.</em> to their involuntary
power over the mind. This observation will account for a very
general principle in the mind, which cannot, we conceive, be satisfactorily
explained in any other way, we mean <em>the power of fascination</em>.
Every one has heard the story of the girl who being left alone by
her companions, in order to frighten her, in a room with a dead body,
at first attempted to get out, and shrieked violently for assistance, but
finding herself shut in, ran and embraced the corpse, and was found
senseless in its arms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that in such cases there is a desperate effort made to get
rid of the dread by converting it into the reality. There may be
some truth in this account, but we do not think it contains the whole
truth. The event produced in the present instance does not bear out
the conclusion. The progress of the passion does not seem to have
been that of diminishing or removing the terror by coming in contact
with the object, but of carrying this terror to its height from an
intense and irresistible impulse, overcoming every other feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a well-known fact that few persons can stand safely on the
edge of a precipice, or walk along the parapet wall of a house,
without being in danger of throwing themselves down; not we
presume from a principle of self-preservation; but in consequence of
a strong idea having taken possession of the mind, from which it
cannot well escape, which absorbs every other consideration, and
confounds and overrules all self-regards. The impulse cannot in this
case be resolved into a desire to remove the uneasiness of fear, for
the only danger arises from the fear. We have been told by a
person, not at all given to exaggeration, that he once felt a strong
propensity to throw himself into a cauldron of boiling lead, into
which he was looking. These are what Shakespear calls ‘the toys
of desperation.’ People sometimes marry, and even fall in love on
this principle—that is, through mere apprehension, or what is called
a fatality. In like manner, we find instances of persons who are as
it were naturally delighted with whatever is disagreeable,—who
catch all sorts of unbecoming tones and gestures,—who always say
what they should not, and what they do not mean to say,—in whom
intemperance of imagination and incontinence of tongue are a disease,
and who are governed by an almost infallible instinct of absurdity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The love of imitation has the same general source. We dispute
for ever about Hogarth, and the question can never be decided
according to the common ideas on the subject of taste. His pictures
appeal to the love of truth, not to the sense of beauty; but the one is
as much an essential principle of our nature as the other. They fill
up the void of the mind; they present an everlasting succession and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>variety of ideas. There is a fine observation somewhere made by
Aristotle, that the mind has a natural appetite of curiosity or desire
to know; and ‘most of that knowledge which comes in by the eye,
for this presents us with the greatest variety of differences.’ Hogarth
is relished only by persons of a certain strength of mind and penetration
into character; for the subjects in themselves are not pleasing,
and this objection is only redeemed by the exercise and activity
which they give to the understanding. The great difference between
what is meant by a severe and an effeminate taste or style, depends
on the distinction here made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our teasing ourselves to recollect the names of places or persons
we have forgotten, the love of riddles and of abstruse philosophy, are
all illustrations of the same general principle of curiosity, or the love
of intellectual excitement. Again, our impatience to be delivered of
a secret that we know; the necessity which lovers have for confidants,
auricular confession, and the declarations so commonly made by
criminals of their guilt, are effects of the involuntary power exerted
by the imagination over the feelings. Nothing can be more untrue,
than that the whole course of our ideas, passions, and pursuits, is
regulated by a regard to self-interest. Our attachment to certain
objects is much oftener in proportion to the strength of the impression
they make on us, to their power of rivetting and fixing the attention,
than to the gratification we derive from them. We are perhaps more
apt to dwell upon circumstances that excite disgust and shock our
feelings, than on those of an agreeable nature. This, at least, is the
case where this disposition is particularly strong, as in people of
nervous feelings and morbid habits of thinking. Thus the mind is
often haunted with painful images and recollections, from the hold
they have taken of the imagination. We cannot shake them off,
though we strive to do it: nay, we even court their company; we
will not part with them out of our presence; we strain our aching
sight after them; we anxiously recal every feature, and contemplate
them in all their aggravated colours. There are a thousand passions
and fancies that thwart our purposes and disturb our repose. Grief
and fear are almost as welcome inmates of the breast as hope or joy,
and more obstinately cherished. We return to the objects which
have excited them, we brood over them, they become almost inseparable
from the mind, necessary to it; they assimilate all objects to the
gloom of our own thoughts, and make the will a party against itself.
This is one chief source of most of the passions that prey like
vultures on the heart, and embitter human life. We hear moralists
and divines perpetually exclaiming, with mingled indignation and
surprise, at the folly of mankind in obstinately persisting in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>tormenting and violent passions, such as envy, revenge, sullenness,
despair, &#38;c. This is to them a mystery; and it will always remain
an inexplicable one, while the love of happiness is considered as the
only spring of human conduct and desires.</p>

<p class='c007'>The love of power or action is another independent principle of the
human mind, in the different degrees in which it exists, and which
are not by any means in exact proportion to its physical sensibility.
It seems evidently absurd to suppose that sensibility to pleasure or
pain is the only principle of action. It is almost too obvious to
remark, that sensibility alone, without an active principle in the mind,
could never produce action. The soul might lie dissolved in
pleasure, or be agonised with woe; but the impulses of feeling, in
order to excite passion, desire, or will, must be first communicated to
some other faculty. There must be a principle, a fund of activity
somewhere, by and through which our sensibility operates; and that
this active principle owes all its force, its precise degree and direction,
to the sensitive faculty, is neither self-evident nor true. Strength of
will is not always nor generally in proportion to strength of feeling.
There are different degrees of activity as of sensibility in the mind;
and our passions, characters, and pursuits, often depend no less upon
the one than on the other. We continually make a distinction in
common discourse between sensibility and irritability, between passion
and feeling, between the nerves and muscles; and we find that the
most voluptuous people are in general the most indolent. Every one
who has looked closely into human nature must have observed persons
who are naturally and habitually restless in the extreme, but without
any extraordinary susceptibility to pleasure or pain, always making or
finding excuses to do something,—whose actions constantly outrun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the occasion, and who are eager in the pursuit of the greatest trifles,—whose
impatience of the smallest repose keeps them always
employed about nothing,—and whose whole lives are a continued
work of supererogation. There are others again who seem born to
act from a spirit of contradiction only, that is, who are ready to act
not only without a reason, but against it,—who are ever at cross-purposes
with themselves and others,—who are not satisfied unless
they are doing two opposite things at a time,—who contradict
what you say, and if you assent to them, contradict what they have
said,—who regularly leave the pursuit in which they are successful to
engage in some other in which they have no chance of success,—who
make a point of encountering difficulties and aiming at impossibilities,
that there may be no end of their exhaustless task: while there is a
third class whose <i><span lang="la">vis inertiæ</span></i> scarcely any motives can overcome,—who
are devoured by their feelings, and the slaves of their passions,
but who can take no pains and use no means to gratify them,—who,
if roused to action by any unforeseen accident, require a continued
stimulus to urge them on,—who fluctuate between desire and want of
resolution,—whose brightest projects burst like a bubble as soon as
formed,—who yield to every obstacle,—who almost sink under the
weight of the atmosphere,—who cannot brush aside a cobweb in their
path, and are stopped by an insect’s wing. Indolence is want of will—the
absence or defect of the active principle—a repugnance to
motion; and whoever has been much tormented with this passion,
must, we are sure, have felt that the inclination to indulge it is
something very distinct from the love of pleasure or actual enjoyment.
Ambition is the reverse of indolence, and is the love of power or
action in great things. Avarice, also, as it relates to the acquisition
of riches, is, in a great measure, an active and enterprising feeling;
nor does the hoarding of wealth, after it is acquired, seem to have
much connection with the love of pleasure. What is called niggardliness,
very often, we are convinced from particular instances that we
have known, arises less from a selfish principle than from a love of
contrivance, from the study of economy as an art, for want of a
better, from a pride in making the most of a little, and in not exceeding
a certain expense previously determined upon; all which is
wilfulness, and is perfectly consistent, as it is frequently found united,
with the most lavish expenditure and the utmost disregard for
money on other occasions. A miser may in general be looked upon
as a particular species of <i><span lang="it">virtuoso</span></i>. The constant desire in the rich to
leave wealth in large masses, by aggrandising some branch of their
families, or sometimes in such a manner as to accumulate for centuries,
shews that the imagination has a considerable share in this passion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Intemperance, debauchery, gluttony, and other vices of that kind,
may be attributed to an excess of sensuality or gross sensibility;
though even here, we think it evident that habits of intoxication are
produced quite as much by the strength as by the agreeableness of the
excitement; and with respect to some other vicious habits, curiosity
makes many more votaries than inclination. The love of truth,
when it predominates, produces inquisitive characters, the whole
tribe of gossips, tale-bearers, harmless busy bodies, your blunt
honest creatures, who never conceal what they think, and who are the
more sure to tell it you the less you want to hear it,—and now and
then a philosopher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our passions in general are to be traced more immediately to the
active part of our nature, to the love of power, or to strength of will.
Such are all those which arise out of the difficulty of accomplishment,
which become more intense from the efforts made to attain the
object, and which derive their strength from opposition. Mr. Hobbes
says well on this subject:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘But for an utmost end, in which the ancient philosophers placed
felicity, and disputed much concerning the way thereto, there is no
such thing in this world nor way to it, than to Utopia; for while we
live, we have desires, and desire presupposeth a further end. Seeing
all delight is appetite, and desire of something further, there can be
no contentment but in proceeding, and therefore we are not to marvel,
when we see that as men attain to more riches, honour, or other
power, so their appetite continually groweth more and more; and
when they are come to the utmost degree of some kind of power,
they pursue some other, as long as in any kind they think themselves
behind any other. Of those therefore that have attained the highest
degree of honour and riches, some have affected mastery in some art,
as Nero in music and poetry, Commodus in the art of a gladiator;
and such as affect not some such thing, must find diversion and
recreation of their thoughts in the contention either of play or business,
and men justly complain as of a great grief that they know not what
to do. Felicity, therefore, by which we mean continual delight,
consists not in having prospered, but in prospering.’</p>

<p class='c007'>This account of human nature, true as it is, would be a mere
romance, if physical sensibility were the only faculty essential to man,
that is, if we were the slaves of voluptuous indolence. But our
desires are kindled by their own heat, the will is urged on by a
restless impulse, and, without action, enjoyment becomes insipid.
The passions of men are not in proportion only to their sensibility, or
to the desirableness of the object, but to the violence and irritability
of their tempers, and the obstacles to their success. Thus an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>object, to which we were almost indifferent while we thought it in our
power, often excites the most ardent pursuit or the most painful
regret, as soon as it is placed out of our reach. How eloquently is
the contradiction between our desires and our success described in
Don Quixote where it is said of the lover, that ‘he courted a statue,
hunted the wind, cried aloud to the desert!’</p>

<p class='c007'>The necessity of action to the mind, and the keen edge it gives to
our desires, is shewn in the different value we set on past and future
objects. It is commonly and we might almost say universally
supposed, that there is an essential difference in the two cases. In
this instance, however, the strength of our passions has converted an
evident absurdity into one of the most inveterate prejudices of the
human mind. That the future is really or in itself of more consequence
than the past, is what we can neither assent to nor even
conceive. It is true, the past has ceased to be and is no longer any
thing, except to the mind; but the future is still to come, and has an
existence in the mind only. The one is at an end, the other has not
even had a beginning; both are purely ideal: so that this argument
would prove that the present only is of any real value, and that both
past and future objects are equally indifferent, alike nothing. Indeed,
the future is, if possible, more imaginary than the past; for the past
may in some sense be said to exist in its consequences; it acts still;
it is present to us in its effects; the mouldering ruins and broken
fragments still remain; but of the future there is no trace. What
a blank does the history of the world for the next six thousand years,
present to the mind, compared with that of the last! All that
strikes the imagination, or excites any interest in the mighty scene, is
<em>what has been</em>. Neither in reality, then, nor as a subject of general
contemplation, has the future any advantage over the past; but with
respect to our own passions and pursuits it has. We regret the
pleasures we have enjoyed, and eagerly anticipate those which are to
come; we dwell with satisfaction on the evils from which we have
escaped, and dread future pain. The good that is past is like
money that is spent, which is of no use, and about which we give
ourselves no farther concern. The good we expect is like a store
yet untouched, in the enjoyment of which we promise ourselves
infinite gratification. What has happened to us we think of no
consequence,—what is to happen to us, of the greatest. Why so?
Because the one is in our power, and the other not; because
the efforts of the will to bring an object to pass or to avert it
strengthen our attachment to or our aversion from that object;
because the habitual pursuit of any purpose redoubles the ardour of
our pursuit, and converts the speculative and indolent interest we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>should otherwise take in it into real passion. Our regrets, anxiety,
and wishes, are thrown away upon the past, but we encourage our
disposition to exaggerate the importance of the future, as of the
utmost use in aiding our resolutions and stimulating our exertions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It in some measure confirms this theory, that men attach more
or less importance to past and future events, according as they are
more or less engaged in action and the busy scenes of life. Those
who have a fortune to make, or are in pursuit of rank and power, are
regardless of the past, for it does not contribute to their views: those
who have nothing to do but to think, take nearly the same interest in
the past as in the future. The contemplation of the one is as delightful
and real as of the other. The season of hope comes to an end,
but the remembrance of it is left. The past still lives in the memory
of those who have leisure to look back upon the way that they have
trod, and can from it ‘catch glimpses that may make them less
forlorn.’ The turbulence of action and uneasiness of desire <em>must</em>
dwell upon the future; it is only amidst the innocence of shepherds,
in the simplicity of the pastoral ages, that a tomb was found with this

<p class='c007'>We feel that some apology is necessary for having thus plunged
our readers all at once into the middle of metaphysics. If it should
be asked what use such studies are of, we might answer with Hume,
<em>perhaps of none, except that there are certain persons who find more entertainment
in them than in any other</em>. An account of this matter, with
which we were amused ourselves, and which may therefore amuse
others, we met with some time ago in a metaphysical allegory, which
begins in this manner:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘In the depth of a forest, in the kingdom of Indostan, lived a
monkey, who, before his last step of transmigration, had occupied
a human tenement. He had been a Bramin, skilful in theology, and
in all abstruse learning. He was wont to hold in admiration the
ways of Nature, and delighted to penetrate the mysteries in which
she was enrobed; but in pursuing the footsteps of philosophy, he
wandered too far from the abode of the social Virtues. In order to
pursue his studies, he had retired to a cave on the banks of the
Jumna. There he forgot society, and neglected ablution; and therefore
his soul was degraded to a condition below humanity. So
inveterate were the habits which he had contracted in his human
state, that his spirit was still influenced by his passion for abstruse
study. He sojourned in this wood from youth to age, regardless of
everything, <em>save cocoa-nuts and metaphysics</em>.’ For our own part, we
should be content to pass our time much in the same way as this
learned savage, if we could only find a substitute for his cocoa-nuts!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>We do not however wish to recommend the same pursuit to others,
nor to dissuade them from it. It has its pleasures and its pains—its
successes and its disappointments. It is neither quite so sublime nor
quite so uninteresting as it is sometimes represented. The worst is,
that much thought on difficult subjects tends, after a certain time, to
destroy the natural gaiety and dancing of the spirits; it deadens the
elastic force of the mind, weighs upon the heart, and makes us
insensible to the common enjoyments and pursuits of life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Sithence no fairy lights, no quick’ning ray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor stir of pulse, nor objects to entice</div>
      <div class='line'>Abroad the spirits; but the cloyster’d heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Sits squat at home, like pagod in a niche</div>
      <div class='line'>Obscure.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Metaphysical reasoning is also one branch of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil. The study of man, however, does, perhaps,
less harm than a knowledge of the world, though it must be owned
that the practical knowledge of vice and misery makes a stronger
impression on the mind, when it has imbibed a habit of abstract
reasoning. Evil thus becomes embodied in a general principle, and
shews its harpy form in all things. It is a fatal, inevitable necessity
hanging over us. It follows us wherever we go: if we fly into the
uttermost parts of the earth, it is there: whether we turn to the right
or the left, we cannot escape from it. This, it is true, is the disease
of philosophy; but it is one to which it is liable in minds of a certain
cast, after the first order of expectation has been disabused by
experience, and the finer feelings have received an irrecoverable
shock from the jarring of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Happy are they who live in the dream of their own existence,
and see all things in the light of their own minds; who walk by
faith and hope; to whom the guiding star of their youth still shines
from afar, and into whom the spirit of the world has not entered!
They have not been ‘hurt by the archers,’ nor has the iron entered
their souls. They live in the midst of arrows and of death, unconscious
of harm. The evil things come not nigh them. The shafts
of ridicule pass unheeded by, and malice loses its sting. The
example of vice does not rankle in their breasts, like the poisoned shirt
of Nessus. Evil impressions fall off from them like drops of water.
The yoke of life is to them light and supportable. The world has
no hold on them. They are in it, not of it; and a dream and a
glory is ever around them!</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing can frequently be more striking than the difference of style
or manner, where the <em>matter</em> remains the same, as in paraphrases and
translations. The most remarkable example which occurs to us is in
the beginning of the <cite>Flower and Leaf</cite> by Chaucer, and in the modernisation
of the same passage by Dryden. We shall give an extract
from both, that the reader may judge for himself. The original runs

      <div class='line'>That the voices to angels most was like.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In this passage the poet has let loose the very soul of pleasure.
There is a spirit of enjoyment in it, of which there seems no end. It
is the intense delight which accompanies the description of every
object, the fund of natural sensibility it displays, which constitutes its
whole essence and beauty. Now this is shewn chiefly in the manner
in which the different objects are anticipated, and the eager welcome
which is given to them; in his repeating and varying the circumstances
with a restless delight; in his quitting the subject for a moment,
and then returning to it again, as if he could never have his fill of
enjoyment. There is little of this in Dryden’s paraphrase. The
same ideas are introduced, but not in the same manner, nor with the
same spirit. The imagination of the poet is not borne along with the
tide of pleasure—the verse is not poured out, like the natural strains
it describes, from pure delight, but according to rule and measure.
Instead of being absorbed in his subject, he is dissatisfied with it, tries
to give an air of dignity to it by factitious ornaments, to amuse the
reader by ingenious allusions, and divert his attention from the progress
of the story by the artifices of the style.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Compared with Chaucer, Dryden and the rest of that school were
merely <em>verbal poets</em>. They had a great deal of wit, sense and fancy;
they only wanted truth and depth of feeling. But we shall have to say
more on this subject, when we come to consider the old question
which we have got marked down in our list, whether Pope was a
poet?</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to the subject of our last Number, Lord Chesterfield’s
character of the Duke of Marlborough is a good illustration of his
general theory. He says:—‘Of all the men I ever knew in my life
(and I knew him extremely well) the late Duke of Marlborough
possessed the graces in the highest degree, not to say engrossed them;
for I will venture (contrary to the custom of profound historians, who
always assign deep causes for great events) to ascribe the better half
of the Duke of Marlborough’s greatness and riches to those graces.
He was eminently illiterate: wrote bad English, and spelt it worse.
He had no share of what is commonly called parts; that is, no brightness,
nothing shining in his genius. He had most undoubtedly an
excellent good plain understanding with sound judgment. But these
alone would probably have raised him but something higher than
they found him, which was page to King James <span class='fss'>II.</span>’s Queen.
There the graces protected and promoted him; for while he was
Ensign of the Guards, the Duchess of Cleveland, then favourite
mistress of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>, struck by these very graces, gave him five
thousand pounds; with which he immediately bought an annuity of
five hundred pounds a year, which was the foundation of his subsequent
fortune. His figure was beautiful, but his manner was irresistible by
either man or woman. It was by this engaging, graceful manner,
that he was enabled during all his wars to connect the various and
jarring powers of the grand alliance, and to carry them on to the
main object of the war, notwithstanding their private and separate
views, jealousies, and wrong headedness. Whatever court he went
to (and he was often obliged to go himself to some resty and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>refractory ones) he as constantly prevailed, and brought them into
his measures.’<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c009'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Grace in woman has often more effect than beauty. We sometimes
see a certain fine self-possession, an habitual voluptuousness of character,
which reposes on its own sensations, and derives pleasure from all
around it, that is more irresistible than any other attraction. There
is an air of languid enjoyment in such persons, ‘in their eyes, in their
arms, and their hands, and their face,’ which robs us of ourselves, and
draws us by a secret sympathy towards them. Their minds are a
shrine where pleasure reposes. Their smile diffuses a sensation like
the breath of spring. Petrarch’s description of Laura answers exactly
to this character, which is indeed the Italian character. Titian’s
pictures are full of it: they seem sustained by sentiment, or as if the
persons whom he painted sat to music. There is one in the Louvre (or
there was) which had the most of this expression, we ever remember.
It did not look downward; ‘it looked forward, beyond this world.’
It was a look that never passed away, but remained unalterable as
the deep sentiment which gave birth to it. It is the same constitutional
character (together with infinite activity of mind) which has
enabled the greatest man in modern history to bear his reverses of
fortune with gay magnanimity, and to submit to the loss of the empire
of the world with as little discomposure as if he had been playing a
game at chess.</p>

<p class='c007'>After all, we would not be understood to say that manner is every
thing.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c009'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Nor would we put Euclid or Sir Isaac Newton on a level with
the first <i><span lang="fr">petit-maître</span></i> we might happen to meet. We consider <cite>Æsop’s
Fables</cite> to have been a greater work of genius than Fontaine’s translation
of them; though we are not sure that we should not prefer Fontaine
for his style only, to Gay, who has shewn a great deal of original
invention. The elegant manners of people of fashion have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>objected to us to shew the frivolity of external accomplishments, and
the facility with which they are acquired. As to the last point, we
demur. There are no class of people who lead so laborious a life, or
who take more pains to cultivate their minds as well as persons, than
people of fashion. A young lady of quality who has to devote so
many hours a day to music, so many to dancing, so many to drawing,
so many to French, Italian, &#38;c., certainly does not pass her time in
idleness; and these accomplishments are afterwards called into action
by every kind of external or mental stimulus, by the excitements of
pleasure, vanity and interest. A Ministerial or Opposition Lord goes
through more drudgery than half a dozen literary hacks; nor does a
reviewer by profession read half the same number of publications as a
modern fine lady is obliged to labour through. We confess, however,
we are not competent judges of the degree of elegance or refinement
implied in the general tone of fashionable manners. The successful
experiment made by <em>Peregrine Pickle</em>, in introducing his strolling
mistress into genteel company, does not redound greatly to their credit.
In point of elegance of external appearance, we see no difference
between women of fashion and women of a different character, who
dress in the same style.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lovers of the drama have had a very rich theatrical treat this
week, Mr. Kean’s first appearance in <cite>Bajazet</cite>, two new <em>Miss Peggys</em>
in the <cite>Country Girl</cite>, and last, though not least, Miss Stephens’s
reappearance in <cite>Polly</cite>. Of Mr. Kean’s <cite>Bajazet</cite> we have not much
to say, without repeating what we have said before. The character
itself is merely calculated for the display of physical passion and
external energy. It is violent, fierce, turbulent, noisy, and blasphemous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>‘full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.’ Mr. Kean
did justice to his author, or went the whole length of the text. A
viper does not dart with more fierceness and rapidity on the person
who has just trod upon it than he turns upon <cite>Tamerlane</cite> in the height
of his fury. An unslaked thirst of vengeance and blood has taken
possession of every faculty, like the savage rage of a hyaena, assailed
by the hunters. His eyeballs glare, his teeth gnash together, his
hands are clenched. In describing his defeat, his voice is choked
with passion; he curses, and the blood curdles in his veins. Never
was the fiery soul of barbarous revenge, stung to madness by repeated
shame and disappointment, so completely displayed. This truth of
nature and passion in Mr. Kean’s acting carries every thing before it.
He was the only person on the stage who seemed alive. The mighty
<cite>Tamerlane</cite> appeared no better than a stuffed figure dressed in ermine,
<em>Arpasia</em> moaned in vain, and <em>Moneses</em> roared out his wrongs unregarded,
like the hoarse sounds of distant thunder. Nothing can
withstand the real tide of passion once let loose; and yet it is pretended,
that the great art of the tragic actor is in damming it up, or
cutting out smooth canals and circular basons for it to flow into, so
that it may do no harm in its course. It is the giving way to natural
and strong impulses of the imagination that floats Mr. Kean down the
stream of public favour with all his faults—‘a load to sink a navy.’
The only wonder was to see this furious character suffered to go
about and take the whole range of the palace of <cite>Tamerlane</cite>, without
the least let or impediment. It shewed a degree of magnanimity in
Mr. Pope, which is without any parallel, even in modern times. It
is understood that the play was originally written by the whig poet
Rowe, and regularly acted on the anniversary of our whig revolution,
as a compliment to King William, and a satire on Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> For
any thing we know, the resemblance of <cite>Tamerlane</cite> to King William
may be sufficiently strong, there the historian and the poet may agree
tolerably well; but what traits the Tartar Chieftain and the French
Monarch had in common, it would be difficult to find out. If any
more recent allusion was intended in its revival, it fell still wider of
the mark. The play of <cite>Tamerlane</cite> may be divided into two heads—cant
and rant. <cite>Tamerlane</cite> takes the first part, and <cite>Bajazet</cite> the second.
This last hurls defiance at both gods and men. He is utterly regardless
of consequences, and rushes upon his destruction like a wild beast
into the toils. He utters but one striking sentiment, when he defends
ambition as the hunger of noble minds. <em>Bajazet’s</em> character is energy
without greatness. He is blind to every thing but the present
moment, and insensible to every thing but the present impulse. True
greatness is the reverse of this. It shews all the energy of courage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>but none of the impatience of despair. It struggles with difficulty,
but yields to necessity. It does every thing, and suffers nothing. It
sees events with the eye of history, and makes Time the Judge of
Fortune. Courage with calmness constitutes the perfection of the
heroic character, as the effeminate and sentimental unite the extremes
of activity and irritability. We never saw Mr. Kean look better.
His costume and his colour had a very picturesque effect. The
yellow brown tinge of the Tartar becomes him much better than the
tawny brick-dust complexion of the Moor in <cite>Othello</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now for our two Country Girls. We have seen both without any
great effort of our patience: to confess a truth, we had rather see the
<cite>Country Girl</cite> two nights running than <cite>Tamerlane</cite>; as we would rather
have been Wycherley than Rowe. The comedy of the <cite>Country Girl</cite>
is taken from Moliere’s <cite>School for Wives</cite>. It is however a perfectly
free imitation, or rather an original work, founded on the same general
plot, with additional characters, and in a style wholly different.
Scarcely a line is the same. The long, speechifying dialogues in
the French comedy are cut down into a succession of smart conversations
and lively scenes: there is indeed a certain pastoral sweetness
or sentimental naivete in the character of <em>Agnes</em>, which is lost in
<em>Miss Peggy</em>, who is however the more natural and mischievous little
rustic of the two. The incident of her running up against her
guardian as she is running off with her gallant in the park, and the
contrivance of the second letter which she imposes on her jealous fool
as <em>Alithea’s</em>, are Wycherley’s. The characters of <em>Alithea</em>, <em>Harcourt</em>,
and of the fop <em>Sparkish</em>, who appears to us so exquisite, and to others
so insipid, are additional portraits from the reign and court of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>
Those who object to the scenes between this gentleman and his mistress
as unnatural, can never have read the <cite>Memoirs of the Count de Grammont</cite>,—an
authentic piece of English history, in which we trace the
origin of so many noble families. What an age of wit and folly, of
coxcombs and coquets, when the world of fashion led purely ornamental
lives, and their only object was to make themselves or others
ridiculous. Happy age, when the utmost stretch of a morning’s study
went no further than the choice of a sword knot, or the adjustment
of a side curl; when the soul spoke out in all the persuasive eloquence
of dress; when beaux and belles, enamoured of themselves in one
another’s follies, fluttered like gilded butterflies in giddy mazes
through the walks of St. James’s Park! The perfection of this gala
out-of-door comedy is in Etherege, the gay Sir George! Then
comes Wycherley, and then Congreve, who hands them into the
drawing-room. Congreve is supposed to have been the inventor of
the epigrammatic, clenched style of comic dialogue; but there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>great deal of this both in Wycherley and Etherege, with more of
a <em>janty</em> tone of flippant gaiety in the latter, and more incident, character,
and situation in the former. The <cite>Country Girl</cite> holds unimpaired
possession of the stage to this day, by its wit, vivacity, nature,
and ingenuity. Nothing can be worse acted, and yet it goes down,
for it supplies the imagination with all that the actors want. Mr.
Bartley had some merit as <em>Moody</em>, Mr. Fawcet none. Barrymore,
at Covent Garden played <em>Harcourt</em> well. We have seen him in
better company, and he reminded us of it. He was much of the
gentleman, and as much at home on the stage (from long practice) as
if he had been in his own apartments. As to the two <em>Miss Peggys</em>,
we hardly know how to settle their pretensions. If Mrs. Mardyn
overacts her part to that degree that she seems only to want a
skipping-rope to make it complete, Mrs. Alsop is so stiff and queer
that she seems to have only just escaped from a back-board and steel
monitor. If Mrs. Alsop has the clearest voice, Mrs. Mardyn has
the brightest eyes. Mrs. Alsop has most art, Mrs. Mardyn has
most nature. If Mrs. Mardyn is too profuse of natural graces, too
young and buoyant and exuberant in all her movements, the same
fault cannot be found with Mrs. Alsop, whose smiles give no pleasure,
and whose frowns give unmingled pain. Mrs. Alsop’s <em>Peggy</em> is a
clever recitation of the character, without being the thing; and
Mrs. Mardyn’s is a very full development of her own person, which
is the thing itself. Mrs. Alsop is the best actress, though not worth
a pin, and Mrs. Mardyn is the most desirable woman, which is
always worth something. We may apply to these two ladies what
Suckling said of one of his mistresses—</p>

      <div class='line'>——‘For I had learnt a sense sublime</div>
      <div class='line'>Of something far more deeply interfused,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the round ocean and the living air</div>

      <div class='line'>And rolls through all things.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps, the doctrine of what has been called philosophical necessity
was never more finely expressed than in these lines of a poet, who, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>he had written only half of what he has done, would have deserved
to be immortal. There can be no doubt that all that exists, exists
by necessity; that the vast fabric of the universe is held together in
one mighty chain, reaching to the ‘threshold of Jove’s throne’; that
whatever has a beginning, must have a cause; that there is no object,
no feeling, no action, which, other things being the same, could have
been otherwise; that thought follows thought, like wave following
wave; that chance or accident has no share in any thing that comes
to pass in the moral or the physical world; that whatever is, must
be; that whatever has been, must have been; that whatever is to be
will be necessarily.</p>

<p class='c007'>I never could doubt for a moment of the truth of this general
principle, and I never could comprehend the inferences which have
commonly been drawn from it, both by friends and foes. All the
moral consequences which have been attributed to it appear to me
mere idle prejudices against it on one side, and equally gratuitous concessions
on the other. The doctrine of necessity leaves morality just
where it found it. It does not destroy goodness of disposition or
energy of character, any more than it destroys beauty or strength of
person. It does not take away the powers of the mind any more
than the use of the limbs. That every thing is by necessity, no more
proves that there is no such thing as good and evil, virtue and vice,
right and wrong, in the moral world, than it proves that there is no
such thing as day or night, heat or cold, sweet or sour, food or poison,
in the physical. Merit and demerit, that is to say, praise and blame,
reward and punishment, have no place in the physical world, but that
is because they have no effect there; and for the same reason they
have a place in the moral, because they have an effect there. All the
practical conclusions which have been ascribed to the difference
between liberty and necessity, may be equally accounted for (as they
really had their rise) from the difference between moral and physical
necessity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man acts from a cause; and so far he resembles a stone; but he
does not act from the same cause, and herein he differs from it.
There is a print which I have seen from a picture by Ludovico
Caracci, in which a female figure, with a lion by her side, is represented
striking a flame of fire at her feet with a drawn sword. I do
not very well understand the allegory, but it appears to me to furnish
a very tolerable illustration of the difference between moral and
physical necessity: for whether this figure strikes the flame with the
flat or the sharp side of the sword, it divides and rises again equally;
it is incapable of punishment for it has no sense of pain, nor does it
apprehend a repetition of the blow. Is it the same with the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>mind? No; for it has both the sense of pain and the sense of consequences,
which render it liable to punishment, by making that
punishment one effectual and necessary means of influencing its
conduct. A man differs from a stone in that he has feeling and
understanding; and it is this difference that makes him a moral and
responsible agent in the true meaning of the terms, by connecting his
present impulses with their future consequences. It may be said that
animals have feeling, and a certain degree of understanding: and so
far they are liable to correction and punishment. A dog or a horse
is terrified at the whip or the spur as well as encouraged by kindness.
We very properly, therefore, threaten them with the one and allure
them with the other, though we neither preach to them of heaven nor
hell, because they have no notion about either. As far as they have
understanding, they have free-will, for these two words mean one and
the same thing. Man is the only religious animal, because he alone
(from a greater power of imagination) extends his views of consequences
into another state of being.—The application of praise or
blame, as well as of reward and punishment, is proper, wherever it is
likely to have an effect. We do not talk to the deaf: we do not
shew pictures to the blind; we do not reason with a wild beast; we
do not quarrel with a stone. Because it would be useless. But we
<em>do</em> talk to those who can hear; we shew pictures to those who can
see; we reason with prejudice; we quarrel with ill-nature. The
human mind differs from an inanimate substance or an automaton,
inasmuch as it is actuated by sympathy as well as by necessity. We
indeed praise a flower, a statue, or a beautiful face, because they give
us pleasure: we praise a virtuous action, as an additional incentive to
virtue. ‘Praise and blame, reward and punishment’ (says Mr.
Hobbes) ‘are just and proper, because they fashion the will to
justice.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Merit, in the scholastic sense, means something self-caused, and
independent of motives. This sense of the term is flat nonsense, for
there is nothing without a cause—nothing which is not owing to some
other thing. The whole theory of merit may be said to turn upon
the capacity of any person or thing to mould itself according to the
opinion entertained of it. A stone has not this capacity; and therefore
there is no merit in a stone. If you tell a country girl that she
is handsome or well made, her answer generally will be, that ‘She is
as God made her.’ This however does not prove that she is not
well made. It is only meant to shew, that as she has had no hand
in her own shape, and can do nothing to mend it, the merit is so far
none of hers. But if you praise the neatness of her dress, she has
not the same evasion left, but thinks the flattery well bestowed, for she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>is conscious that this depends upon herself; that she can stay a
longer or a shorter time at her glass as she pleases; and that the pains
she has taken have been with a view to the good opinion you express
of her. The difference between natural and acquired graces is an
obvious dictate of common sense; unless we adopt the opinion of the
Clown, that ‘a good favour is the effect of study, but reading and
writing come by nature.’ It is a piece of brutality and ill-nature to
point at a hump-backed man, and call him My Lord: but there is no
great harm in laughing at a person with an aukward slovenly gait, for
the ridicule may remedy the defect. A person has it in his power to
turn his toes out instead of in, whenever he chuses: he cannot get rid
of a natural deformity by any effort of will. Beauty and power of
every kind excite our love and admiration, whether in nature, in
morals, or in art; but still with a difference. St. Paul’s is a much
nobler as well as larger building than St. Dunstan’s. We accordingly
admire the one much more than the other; but we allow no more
merit to the one than the other. All the difference of merit we
ascribe to the architect, and not to the building. Why so? Because
all the vanity belongs to the architect, and not to the building.—St.
Paul’s stands where it does; it lifts its majestic dome to the skies,
whether it is seen or not, whether it is admired or not. It has
(familiarly speaking) done nothing to deserve our good opinion, for
it has done nothing with a view to it. Now for the same reason that
the building has not, the builder <em>has</em> merited our good opinion, for he
did what he has done with that very view; was sensible to that good
opinion, and stimulated to exertion by it. It is evident that the
admiration we bestow on any work of art, as an actual object, is
involuntary; it makes no difference in the object whether we bestow
it or not; we therefore do not make a point of bestowing it: the
praise we give to the artist is voluntary, and merited in this farther
sense, that we are bound to bestow it as a means to an end: we
indulge it not merely as a sentiment naturally excited by the contemplation
of excellence, but the expression of which is a reward due to
the pains taken by the artist, and to the encouragement of genius.
Disapprobation and punishment on the other hand necessarily give
pain to the person who is the object of them, but it is to produce a
remote good. However, it equally follows in either case, that our
love and hatred of what is amiable or odious in conscious agents must
be different from our feeling towards unconscious ones, from the sense
of the difference of the consequences. The lever, the screw, and
the wedge, are the great instruments of the mechanical world:
opinion, sympathy, praise and blame, reward and punishment, are the
lever, the screw, and the wedge, of the moral world. A house is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>built of stones; human character depends on motives. Is there
therefore no difference between one character and another? As well
might it be said that there is no difference between one building and
another. If merit means something in character, independent of
motives and of all other things, then there can be no such thing as
merit: but if by merit we mean something which excites our approbation
of one character more than another, and which something is
still farther entitled to our approbation, because it depends upon it for
its motive and encouragement, then undoubtedly this word has a
rational meaning in it. To deny praise or blame, reward or punishment,
to actions, because they are produced by motives, is to take
away the prop from a house, because it supports it.—Necessity only
supersedes merit by superseding the operation of motives. It is pretended,
that if any action is not perfectly gratuitous, if it can be traced
to any other cause, the merit must be transferred to that other cause,
and so on without end. This infinite series may be cut short by
observing, that any action is entitled to our good opinion which is
affected by it. If our opinion had no influence on the actions of
others, there would so far be no merit. If any one going up Holborn-hill
is pushed by a stronger man against a window and breaks it, who
is the responsible person? The one who pushed the other, and not
the one who broke the glass. Because punishment or correcting the
moral sense will not prevent a weak man from being pushed against
a window by a strong one, but it will prevent the strong man from
pushing him against it. It makes no difference that this person did
not act at first without a motive; the point is, that here is another
motive which will counteract the former one. The true cause of any
thing in the practical and moral sense, is that, by removing which the
effect ceases. A man is a moral agent only in so far as he can do
what he will: for motives can only operate on the will. A man in
chains or held by force is not accountable for what he does, for blame
or praise him ever so much, and he will do, not what you wish him,
but what others force him to do. You may reasonably exhort a man
not to throw himself over Westminster Bridge, but it is in vain, after
he has thrown himself over, to call out to him to stop. Morality
means that we have the power to do certain things, <em>if we will</em>, or
help them, <em>if we please</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Merit is moral energy. It is the sense of merit which is the great
stimulus of exertion. One thing is more difficult, requires a greater
effort than another. The sense of merit is in proportion to the sense
of difficulty. The highest praise is given to the highest exertions,
the greatest rewards are due where the greatest sacrifices have been
made. The degree of merit depends then on the degree of voluntary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>power exerted: for exertion deserves every kind of encouragement
and assistance as it becomes difficult. We give a boy sixpence for
going a mile; a shilling for going two. We need not offer rewards
and largesses to vice and indolence; for all the sanctions of religion
and morality are not sufficient to correct them. The admiration with
which the story of Marvell and his leg of mutton is read has not
prevented the facility of some modern patriots in commencing
courtiers; but if it should only save us from a single birthday ode, it
will be something. The phlegmatic Dutchman, in playing at skittles,
follows his bowl with his eye, writhes his body to make it turn right,
and cheers it with his voice. If the bowl had sympathy so as to bend
with his body, and to be encouraged to go a little farther by his
praising it, there would be some sense in his doing so. Amphion is
said to have raised the walls of Thebes with the sound of his lyre:
in one sense the fable might be true, for he might have drawn together
and civilized his followers by the power of song. The words which
Madame de Staël some time ago addressed to the Germans, <i><span lang="fr">Allemagne,
tu es une nation, et tu pleurs</span></i>, were not without their effect.
Neither perhaps would the same words be so now, addressed to her
own country—<cite><span lang="fr">France, tu es une nation, et tu pleurs!</span></cite></p>

<p class='c007'>We have been led to these remarks by receiving an epistle from an
elderly maiden lady, who complains that she has spent her whole life
in censuring and back-biting her neighbours, and that by what we let
fall some time ago, about there being no such thing as merit and
demerit, we had debarred her of the only use of her tongue and
pleasure of her life. We are sorry to have interrupted her, and
hope she will now proceed. We have a good deal left to say on the
subject:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Being very busy or very indolent this week (it is no matter which),
we have had recourse to our common-place book (the first or last
resource of authors), and there find the following instances of parallel
passages, which are at the service of the critics. The conclusion of
Voltaire’s tragedy of <cite>Zaire</cite> is the speech of <em>Orosman</em>, who has killed
his mistress, to her brother, <em>Nerestan</em>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[<span lang="fr">‘Et toi, guerrier infortuné,’ &#38;c. to</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>This will probably remind our readers, as it did us, of <em>Othello’s</em>
farewell speech:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘Soft you; a word or two before you go,’ &#38;c.]</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After transcribing the above passage, we were looking about for
the traces of the former one, which had ‘vanished into thin air,’ and
were beginning to suspect that our parallel had totally failed, till in
looking into the lucubrations of Mr. William Wade, who has tried
to pick a hole in Shakespear, we learnt that the French translator of
our poet had <em>bona fide</em> translated the passage into legitimate French
verse, and that Voltaire had in consequence, with singular modesty,
complained that Ducis had improved upon the original and stolen
the whole turn of the passage from him. To be sure, there is a wide
difference in the two passages. There is nothing in the French poet
of the ‘No more of that,’ that fine natural interruption to the
gasconade which his distress had just extorted from him; there
is nothing of ‘One that loved not wisely, but too well,’ there is
nothing of Indian pearls or Arabian gums, nor is there any allusion
to Aleppo, nor description of ‘a malignant and a turbaned Turk’;
nor any thing like that fine return upon himself, and transition from
the depth of a dejected spirit to the recollection of former acts of
daring defiance, while in his despair he inflicts on himself the blow
with which he formerly chastised an insolent foe. These circumstances
are given ‘as over-measure’ in Shakespear, and would be
considered as superfluous and extravagant by the French critics;
yet they are exactly the circumstances which the Moor <cite>Othello</cite> must
have been best acquainted with, and which, as some of the most
striking circumstances of his past life, would be forcibly recalled to
his memory in parting with it. Voltaire has not invented any thing
of the same sort for his dying hero; his speech (though a very good
one of its kind) is, as Susannah says to Trim, ‘as flat as the palm
of one’s hand;’ it has nothing objectionable in it; it is just such
a speech as any crowned head might make in any of the four
quarters of the globe.—May we be allowed to add (in passing),
that Mr. Kean does not act this scene well? He gnashes his teeth,
and strikes the dagger into his bosom, as if he had taken some
particular enmity against his own flesh. But this is not so in
Shakespear. The feeling of <cite>Othello</cite> is a lofty absence of mind, in
which he throws himself back from the present into the past; the
image he recalls furnishes not only the precedent but the consolation
of his present act; and the pang which he inflicts on himself is
relieved, and unconsciously confounded with the recollection of
former acts of grandeur, and elevation of soul. But to proceed.—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>In the <cite>Agamemnon</cite> of Æschylus, is a very beautiful description of
the signal fires that were to announce the destruction of Troy, thus

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke has at this day all over Europe the character of one of
the most profound and original thinkers that ever lived, and he is
perhaps, without any exception, the most barefaced, deliberate, and
bungling plagiarist, that ever appeared in philosophy. The reputation
which he has acquired, as the founder of the new system in philosophy,
or of any part of that system, is a pure imposition. Hobbes was the
undoubted founder of the system; and he not only laid the foundation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>but he completed the building. Every one of the principles of
the modern, material philosophy of the mind, is to be found in his
works, perfect and entire, as it is in the latest commentators of
the French school. He not only took for his basis the principle
that there is no other original faculty in the mind but sensation:
he also pushed this principle into all its consequences, with a severe,
masterly, and honest logic, of which there is scarcely any other
example. By thus shewing the full extent of his system, ‘the very
head and front of his offending,’ without any disguise, he only got
himself an ill name, and his system was consigned to infamy or
oblivion. Mr. Locke adopted the first principle, with a clumsy
addition to it, but so as to secure himself the reputation of an
original thinker; and at the same time, by not following it in a
bold and decided manner into any one of its necessary consequences,
he avoided giving the alarm to popular apprehension, and made a
temporary compromise with the common sense and prejudices of his
readers. The door being however opened to the introduction of
this philosophy, by the admission of the general principle, all the
rest by degrees followed as a matter of course; and it has been
the business of the ablest metaphysicians ever since to clear what has
been considered as the philosophy of Locke, from the inconsistences
and imperfections which he had suffered to creep into it: all which
improvements on Locke’s Essay are only a recurrence to the principles
laid down by Hobbes, in the most explicit and unequivocal
manner. To shew how little this last writer has been read, even by
professed metaphysicians, Hume attributes the doctrine, that there
are no abstract ideas, to Berkeley as an original discovery, though
the arguments used by Berkeley are almost word for word taken
from those used by Hobbes on the same subject. Yet Locke, in
order we suppose to prevent inquiry into the originality of his own
claims, calls Hobbes ‘a justly exploded author.’ This question is
curious (philosophy apart) as a branch of literary history. It is,
we know, dangerous to tamper with established reputation; nor should
we perhaps have ventured to hazard the accusation we have here
made, if we had not been supported by the authority of so well
informed, candid, and respectable a writer as Dugald Stewart, whose
testimony is of the more value, as he does not seem to be aware of
the general propensity of Mr. Locke to appropriate the ideas of
others to his own use, without disguise or acknowledgement. To
any one who takes the trouble to peruse Professor Stewart’s very
elegant Dissertation just published, on the rise and progress of
modern Metaphysics, it will be evident that every one of those
original discoveries, to which the author of the Essay on Human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Understanding owes his celebrity, and on which he particularly
plumed himself, is taken in substance and almost in words from
writers of whom he does not once make mention; for example, his
proposed division of the sciences, brought forward with great parade
and formality, into Physics, Ethics, and Logic, which is the old
division of the Greek philosophy; his definition of words which
are definable or not definable, which is taken expressly from Descartes;
his account of the origin of our ideas, that of association, of the
social compact, etc. which are borrowed from Hobbes; his distinction
of the properties of matter into primary and secondary, and his
theory of consciousness or reflection as a distinct source of ideas,
which belong to Descartes; his hypothesis about animal spirits, as
the medium of association of ideas, adopted from Malbranche; his
account of judgment and wit, which is to be found in Hobbes, &#38;c. &#38;c.
If it be asked, whether Mr. Locke has not had the merit of
combining the materials thus derived from other sources into a
complete and masterly system, the answer would be, that his work
is one of the most confused, undigested, and contradictory, that has
been published on the subject. There is no one to whom those lines
of the poet were ever more applicable.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We should hope that Mr. Stewart will examine into and state
his conviction on this question fully and clearly in the account of
Mr. Locke’s Essay, which he has promised in the continuation
of his work. If he would lend the sanction of his name to shew the
real foundation on which Mr. Locke’s reputation rests, it would not
be the least service he has rendered to philosophy. ‘To trace an
error to its source is often the only way to refute it.’ The task is no
doubt an invidious, but it is a necessary one. The name of Locke
is in a manner dear to every lover of truth; but truth itself should be
still dearer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will perhaps be amusing to the reader (though not initiated in
such studies) to see the manner in which an idea is bandied about, in
these speculations, from author to author, to no sort of purpose.
‘In one of Mr. Locke’s most noted remarks,’ (says the learned
Professor) ‘he has been anticipated by Malbranche, on whose clear
yet concise statement he does not seem to have thrown much new
light by his very diffuse and wordy commentary.’—‘If in having our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>ideas in the memory ready at hand, consists quickness of parts; in
this of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to distinguish
one thing from another, where there is but the least difference,
consists, in a great measure, the exactness of judgment and clearness
of reason; which is to be observed in one man above another. And
hence perhaps may be given some reason of that common observation,
that men who have a great deal of wit and prompt memories, have
not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For Wit, lying
most in the assemblage of ideas, and putting those together with
quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or
congruity, thereby to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions
in the fancy: Judgment on the contrary, lies quite on the other
side, in separating carefully one from another, ideas wherein can
be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by
similitude and by affinity to take one thing for another.’—<cite>Essay</cite>, <i><span lang="la">etc.</span></i>
B. ii. c. xi. § 2.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="fr">‘Il y a donc des esprits de deux sortes. Les uns remarquent
aisément les différences des choses, et ce sont les bons esprits. Les
autres imaginent et supposent de la ressemblance entr’elles, et ce sont
les esprits superficielles.’—<cite>Recherche de la Vérité.</cite></span></p>

<p class='c007'>‘At an earlier period, Bacon had pointed out the same cardinal
distinction in the intellectual characters of individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The greatest and as it were radical distinction of geniuses, in
respect of philosophy and science, is this; that some are more able
and apt at noting the differences of things; others at noting their
similitudes. For steady and acute minds can fix their contemplations,
and remain and dwell on every subtlety of distinction; whereas more
lofty and discursive imaginations recognize and compound even the
slightest and commonest resemblances of things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<em>That strain I heard was of a higher mood!</em>—It is evident that
Bacon has here seized, in its most general form, the very important
truth perceived by his two ingenious successors in particular cases.
<em>Wit</em>, which Locke contrasts with <em>Judgment</em>, is only one of the various
talents connected with what Bacon calls the <em>discursive genius</em>; and
indeed a talent very subordinate in dignity to most of the others.’—<cite>Note
to the Dissertation</cite>, p. 116.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Locke, by Wit, in the passage here referred to, evidently
means ingenuity or fancy generally speaking; for in the last hundred
years, the use of this term has undergone a great alteration. He
however borrowed his definition immediately from ‘that exploded
author,’ Hobbes, who says in the <cite>Leviathan</cite>, p. 32,—‘Whereas, in
the succession of thoughts, there is nothing to observe in the things
we think on, but either in what they be like one another, or in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>they be unlike;—those that observe their similitudes, in case they be
such as are but rarely observed by others, are said to have a good
wit, by which is meant on this occasion a good fancy. But they that
observe their differences and dissimilitudes, which is called distinguishing
and discerning and judging between thing and thing, in
case such discerning be not easy, are said to have a good judgment;
and particularly in matters of conversation and business, wherein
times, places, and persons, are to be discerned, this virtue is called
Discretion.’</p>

<p class='c007'>What is most remarkable in this traditional definition of wit and
judgment, is, that it is altogether unfounded; for as Harris, the
author of <cite>Hermes</cite>, has very well observed, the finding out the
equality of the three angles of a triangle to two right ones, would,
upon the principles here stated, be a sally of wit, instead of an act of
the understanding, and Euclid’s Elements a collection of <i><span lang="fr">bon mots</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be said in explanation, that wit discovers false resemblances
only. But neither is this true. Wit consists in an illustration of an
idea by some lucky coincidence or contrast, which idea may be either
false or true, as it happens. But the best wit is always the truest.
When the French punsters the other day changed the title of some
loyal order from <cite>Compagnons du Lys</cite> into <cite>Compagnons d’Ulysse</cite>, the
wit lost none of its efficacy, because there was a lurking suspicion in
the mind that the insinuation was true. When Mr. Grattan, some
years ago, said, that the only resources of Ministers were ‘the guinea
or the gallows,’ the alliteration proved nothing, but neither did it
disprove any thing. When the late ingenious Professor Porson, in
reply to some enthusiast of the modern school of poetry, who was
exclaiming ‘that some contemporary bards would be admired when
Homer and Virgil were forgotten,’ made answer,—‘And not till
then,’—he shewed more wit, and perhaps not less judgment, than his
antagonist. Besides, the wit here consisted in the distinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall shortly go more into this subject in three papers, which
we propose to write, on Imagination, Wit, and Judgment, when we
shall endeavour to shew that these faculties, though not the same, nor
always found together, are not so incompatible as dullness on the one
hand, and folly on the other, would lead the world to suppose. The
most sensible man of our acquaintance is also the wittiest; and the
most extravagant blockhead the dullest matter-of-fact man. The
greatest poet that ever lived, had the most understanding of human
nature and affairs. Martinus Scriblerus contains the best commentary
on the Categories; and we shrewdly suspect that Voltaire and Moliere
were two as wise men, that is, knew as many things that were true
and useful, as Malbranche and Descartes. It would have been hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>to persuade either of those laughing philosophers that they saw all
things in God, or that animals were machines. These are ‘the
laborious fooleries’ of the understanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Stewart has interspersed his history of the progress of opinions
with some interesting biographical sketches. Of Anthony Arnaud,
the author of the <cite>Port Royal Logic</cite>, we learn, that ‘he lived to the
age of eighty-three, continuing to write against Malbranche’s opinions
concerning <cite>Nature and Grace</cite>, to his last hour.’ He died, says his
biographer, in an obscure retreat at Brussels, in 1692, without
fortune, and even without the comfort of a servant; he, whose
nephew had been a minister of state, and who might himself have
been a cardinal. The pleasure of being able to publish his sentiments
was to him a sufficient recompense. Nicole, his friend and companion
in arms, worn out at length with these incessant disputes, expressed a
wish to retire from the field, and to enjoy repose. ‘<em>Repose!</em>’
replied Arnaud; ‘won’t you have the whole of eternity to repose in?’—An
anecdote which is told of his infancy, when considered in
connection with his subsequent life, affords a good illustration of the
force of impressions received in the first dawn of reason. He was
amusing himself one day with some childish sport, in the library of
the Cardinal du Perron, when he requested of the Cardinal to give
him a pen:—And for what purpose? said the Cardinal.—To write
books, like you, against the Huguenots. The Cardinal, it is added,
who was old and infirm, could not conceal his joy at the prospect of
so hopeful a successor: and, as he was putting the pen into his hand,
said, ‘I give it to you as the dying shepherd Damaetas bequeathed
his pipe to the little Corydon.’ Of the celebrated metaphysician
Descartes, it appears that he was ‘a bold campaigner’ in his youth;
that he served in Holland under Prince Maurice of Nassau; in
Germany, under Maximilian of Bavaria, in the thirty years’ war; in
Hungary, and at the siege of Rochelle, as a volunteer against the
English. He passed his life in camps till the age of five-and-twenty,
when he retired to spend the remainder of it—in proving his own
existence! What then, it may be asked after all, is the use of such
studies and pursuits? Of the same use as pursuing gilded butterflies,
or any other toy that amuses the mind. Mr. Hume fixed his
residence, while composing his Treatise of <cite>Human Nature</cite>, at the
village of La Flèche, where Descartes was brought up. This is an
interesting trait in the life of a philosopher, who was by no means of
the romantic cast. We do not very well understand the lenity or
rather the respect with which the memory of Mr. Hume is always
treated by our author, who is so hard upon Hobbes and others.
There is also too much notice taken of Adam Smith, who, whatever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>might be his merits as a political economist, was of a very subordinate
class as a philosopher—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The tenth transmitter of a foolish creed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>May we add, that the distinctions of Metaphysics and Geography
have nothing in common, nor is truth of any particular country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The learned Professor makes too little account of the German
philosopher Kant, whose maxim that ‘the mind alone is formative,’
is the only lever by which the modern philosophy can be overturned.
He has indeed overlaid this simple principle by his logical technicalities,
his categories and stuff, as Locke has confounded all common
sense with his ideas of sensation and ideas of reflection. Nothing can
be done towards a true theory of the mind, till philosophers are convinced
that all ideas are ideas of the understanding; and that it requires
all the same faculties to have the <em>idea</em> of the stud of a brass nail in an
old arm-chair, that is, the perception of connection, limits, form,
difference, aye, and of abstraction, in this simple object, as in the
highest speculations of theological or metaphysical science. The
modern philosophers contend that the mind has no idea of any thing
but sensible images: the way to turn the tables upon them is then to
prove, that in the idea of every one of these sensible objects, there is
necessarily involved the exercise of all those faculties, of which they
deny the existence, and which are exerted, only in a different degree,
in the most simple or the most refined operations of the understanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shakespear’s women (we mean those who were his favourites, and
whom he intended to be the favourites of the reader) exist almost
entirely in the relations and charities of domestic life. They are
nothing in themselves, but every thing in their attachment to others.
We think as little of their persons as they do themselves, because we
are let into the secrets of their hearts, which are more important.
We are too much interested in their affairs to stop to look at their
faces, except by stealth and at intervals. We catch their beauties
only sideways as in a glass, but we everywhere meet their hearts
coming at us,—<em>full butt</em>, as <em>Miss Peggy</em> meets her husband in the
Park. No one ever hit the true perfection of the female character,
the sense of weakness leaning on the strength of its affections for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>support, so well as Shakespear—no one ever so well painted natural
tenderness free from all affectation and disguise, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Calls true love acted simple modesty’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>no one else ever so well shewed how delicacy and timidity, urged to
an extremity, grow romantic and extravagant, for the romance of his
heroines (in which they abound) is only an excess of the common
prejudices of their sex, scrupulous of being false to their vows, truant
to their affections, and taught by the force of their feelings when to
forego the forms of propriety for the essence of it. His women are
in this respect exquisite logicians, for they argue from what they feel,
and that is a sure game, when the stake is deep. They know their
own minds exactly. High imagination springs from deep habit; and
Shakespear’s women only followed up the idea of what they liked,
of what they had sworn to with their tongues, and what was engraven
on their hearts, into its untoward consequences. They were the
prettiest little set of martyrs and confessors on record.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have almost as great an affection for <em>Imogen</em> as she had for
<em>Posthumus</em>; and she deserves it rather better. Of all Shakespear’s
women she is perhaps the most touching, the most tender, and the
most true. As to <em>Desdemona</em>, who was alone a match for her in good
faith and heroic self-devotion, she had her faults, and she suffered for
them. <em>Imogen’s</em> incredulity as to her husband’s infidelity is much
the same as <em>Desdemona’s</em> backwardness to believe Othello’s jealousy.
Her answer to the most distressing part of the picture is only, ‘my
Lord, I fear, has forgot Britain.’ Her readiness to pardon <em>Iachimo’s</em>
falsehoods, and his designs upon her virtue, is a good lesson to prudes;
and shews (as perhaps Shakespear intended it, or nature for him)
that where there is a strong attachment to virtue, it has no need to
bolster itself up with an outrageous or affected antipathy to vice.
The morality of Shakespear in this way is great; but it is not to be
found in the four last lines of his plays, in the form of extreme
unction. The scene in which <em>Pisanio</em> gives <em>Imogen</em> her husband’s
letter accusing her of incontinency, is as fine as anything could be:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>‘<em>Pisanio.</em> What cheer, Madam?</div>

      <div class='line'>To lie in watch there, and to think on him?</div>

      <div class='line'>Nor tent to bottom that.’——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When <em>Pisanio</em>, who had been charged to kill his mistress, puts her
in a way to live, she says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Why, good fellow,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Yet when he advises her to disguise herself in boy’s clothes, and
suggests ‘a course pretty and full in view,’ by which she may ‘happily
be near the residence of <em>Posthumus</em>,’ she exclaims—</p>

      <div class='line in2'>‘Oh, for such means,</div>

      <div class='line'>I would adventure.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And when <em>Pisanio</em>, enlarging on the consequences, tells her she
must change—</p>

<p class='c007'>In her journey thus disguised to Milford-Haven, she loses her

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>——‘My dear Lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art one of the false ones: now I think on thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>My hunger’s gone; but even before, I was</div>
      <div class='line'>At point to sink for food.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>She afterwards finds, as she thinks, the dead body of <em>Posthumus</em>,
and engages herself as a foot-boy to serve a Roman Officer, when
she has done all due obsequies to him whom she calls her former
master:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——‘And when</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Now this is the very religion of love. Is it not? All this, which
is the essence of the character, is free from every thing like personal
flattery or laboured description. She relies little on her personal
charms, which she fears may have been eclipsed by some painted jay
of Italy; she relies only on her merit, and her merit is in the depth
of her love, her truth and constancy. Our admiration of her beauty
is excited as it were with as little consciousness as possible on her
part. There are two delicious descriptions given of her, one when
she is asleep, and one when she is supposed dead. <em>Arviragus</em> thus
addresses her:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——‘With fairest flowers,</div>

      <div class='line'>The flow’r that’s like thy face, pale primrose, nor</div>
      <div class='line'>The azure’d hare-bell, like thy veins, no, nor</div>
      <div class='line'>The leaf of eglantine, which not to slander,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out-sweeten’d not thy breath.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The yellow <em>Iachimo</em> gives another thus, when he steals into her

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>There is a moral sense in the proud beauty of this last image, a
rich surfeit of the fancy,—as that well-known passage beginning, ‘Me
of my lawful pleasure she restrained, and prayed me oft forbearance,’
sets a keener edge upon it by the inimitable picture of modesty and
self-denial. <em>Desdemona</em> is another instance (almost to a proverb) of
the devotedness of the sex to a favourite object. She is ‘subdued
even to the very quality of her lord,’ and to <em>Othello’s</em> ‘honours and
his valiant parts her soul and fortunes consecrates.’ The lady
protests as much herself, and she is as good as her word. There
is not a set description of her in any part of the play; and the only
thing that tends that way is the equivocal and somewhat luscious
dialogue that takes place between <em>Iago</em> and <em>Cassio</em> as an accompaniment
to the ceremonies of the wedding-night. We see her visage in
her mind: her character every where predominates over her person:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A maiden, never bold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion</div>
      <div class='line'>Blush’d at itself.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>She is not a painted idol, carved out of the poet’s brain, but is herself
a worshipper at the shrine of duty. As Milton dashes the
luxurious effect of his descriptions by a moral, Shakespear qualifies
it by the interest of the story, as in the scene where <cite>Othello</cite> takes
<em>Desdemona</em> by the hand. The truth of conception, with which
timidity and boldness are united in the same character, is marvellous.
The extravagance of her actions, the pertinacity of her affections, in
a manner arises out of the gentleness of her nature. It is an unreserved
reliance on the purity of her intentions, a surrender of her
fears to her love, a knitting of herself (heart and soul) to the fate of
another. Bating the commencement of her passion, which is a little
fantastical and self-willed (though that may be accounted for in the
same way from an inability to resist a rising inclination) her whole
character consists in having no will of her own, no prompter but her
obedience. Her romantic turn is only a consequence of the domestic
and practical part of her disposition; and instead of following
<cite>Othello</cite> to Cyprus, she would rather have remained at home, ‘a moth
of peace,’ if her husband could have staid with her. Her resignation
and angelic sweetness of nature do not desert her at the last. The
scenes in which she laments and tries to account for <em>Othello’s</em> harsh
usage of her are exquisitely managed. After he has struck her and
called her names, she says:</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The scene which follows with her maid and the song of the
Willow are equally beautiful, and shew Shakespear’s extreme power
of varying the expression of passion, in all its moods and in all
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the finest passages in Mr. Wordsworth’s poems is that
where he has given us his opinion of <em>Desdemona</em>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Books, dreams, are each a world; and books, we know,</div>

      <div class='line'>Our pastime and our happiness may grow;</div>

      <div class='line'>The gentle lady wedded to the Moor,</div>
      <div class='line'>And heavenly Una with her milk-white lamb.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We have said enough to explain our idea of the general turn of
Shakespear’s female characters. We need not mention <em>Ophelia</em> or
<em>Cordelia</em>, both of which admit of little external decoration, and which
it would seem impossible to treat in any other way than as Shakespear
has represented them, abstracted from every thing but their
heart-breaking ties to others, if Tate had not adorned the person of
<em>Cordelia</em> with a number of beauties, and finished her story with a
lover. <em>Cleopatra</em>, who has certainly a personal identity of her own,
and who is described in all the glowing pomp of eastern luxury, is
not an exception to what we have said, for she is not intended as a
model of her sex. What we best recollect of <em>Cressida</em>, is <em>Pandarus’s</em>
description of her after bringing her to the tent, where he says,—‘And
her heart beats like a new-ta’en sparrow’—which must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>allowed to be quite Shakesperian. <em>Miranda</em> appears to be the most
conscious of her charms of any of his favourites (perhaps from the
very solitude in which she had lived), a sort of miracle of her
father’s island, and the goddess of her new-found lover’s idolatry.
<em>Perdita</em> is a very pretty low-born lass, the Queen of curds and cream—but
she makes us think of other things more than of her face.
There is one passage in which the poet has, we suspect, very artfully
rallied the indifference of the sex to abstract reasoning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Perdita.</em> Sir, the fairest flowers o’ th’ season</div>
      <div class='line'>Are our carnations, and streak’d gilly-flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which some call Nature’s bastards: of that kind</div>
      <div class='line'>Our rustic garden’s barren, and I care not</div>
      <div class='line'>To get slips of them.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Polixenes.</em> Wherefore, gentle maiden,</div>
      <div class='line'>Do you neglect them?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Perdita.</em> For I have heard it said,</div>
      <div class='line'>There is an art which, in their piedness shares</div>
      <div class='line'>With great creating nature.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Polixenes.</em> Say, there be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet nature is made better by no mean,</div>
      <div class='line'>But nature makes that mean; so o’er that art</div>
      <div class='line'>Which you say adds to nature, is an art</div>
      <div class='line'>That nature makes: you see, sweet maid, we marry</div>
      <div class='line'>A gentler scyon to the wildest stock,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make conceive a bark of baser kind</div>
      <div class='line'>By bud of nobler race. This is an art</div>
      <div class='line'>Which does mend nature, change it rather; but</div>
      <div class='line'>The art itself is nature.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Perdita.</em> So it is.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Polixenes.</em> Then make your garden rich in gilly-flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And do not call them bastards.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Perdita.</em> <em>I’ll not put</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>The dibble in earth, to set one slip of them</em>,’ etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Here the lady gives up the argument, but keeps her opinion. We
had forgot one charming instance to our purpose, which is the
character of <em>Helen</em> in <cite>All’s Well that Ends Well</cite>; and this also puts
us in mind that Shakespear probably borrowed his female characters
from the Italian novelists, and not from English women.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have few idols, and those few we do not like to lose. But the
warmth of our idolatry of Miss O’Neill will be brought to a much
lower temperature if she goes on playing comedy at this rate. We
cannot form any compromise in our imagination between <cite>Belvidera</cite>
and the <em>Widow Cheerly</em>. To speak our minds plainly, Miss O’Neill is
by far the best tragic actress we ever saw, with one great exception,
and she is the worst comic actress we remember, without any
exception at all. Her comedy is cast in lead, and sad <em>doleful dumps</em>
she makes of it. It is tragedy in low-heeled shoes. Her spirit is
boisterousness; her playfulness languid affectation; her familiarity
oppressive; her gaiety lamentable. There never was such labour in
vain. A smile trickles down her cheek like a tear, and her voice
whines through a repartee in as many winding bouts of mawkish
insinuation as through the most pathetic address. We cannot bear
all this evident condescension; it overpowers us. In one scene she
was very much applauded: it is that in which the <em>Widow Cheerly</em>
gives a characteristic description of her former husband’s introduction
of her to his bottle-companions: ‘This is <em>my</em> wife,’ etc. Now it
cannot be denied that she mimicked the airs and manner of the fox-hunting
squire very well, and her voice fairly gave the house a box
on the ear. But we do not wish to see Miss O’Neill in the part of
<em>Squire Western</em>. We conceive that this delightful actress cannot
descend lower than the soldier’s daughter, except by playing the
sailor’s daughter, and giving the word of command in a striped blue
jacket and trowsers instead of a striped green gown. In these
tom-boy hectoring heroines Mrs. Charles Kemble, whom, to the best
of our belief, she imitates, beats her out and out; and Mrs. Mardyn,
besides being taller and handsomer, has really more of the <i><span lang="la">vis comica</span></i>.
But we will have done with this ungrateful subject. The comedy
itself, of <cite>The Soldier’s Daughter</cite>, is the <i><span lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i> of modern comedy.
It contains the whole theory and practice of sentimentality, of which
a bank-note offered and declined is the circulating medium, and a
white cambric pocket-handkerchief, that catches the crystal tear in
the eye of sensibility ere it falls, the visible emblem. <em>Mr.</em> and <em>Mrs.
Melford</em> are an amiable young couple in lodgings and in great distress,
but you do not learn how they got into one any more than the other.
They utter their complaints, but are too delicate to touch upon the
cause, and you sympathise with their sorrows, not with their misfortunes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>They have a little girl, who has a little doll, which she
christens ‘Miss Good Gentleman,’ after a person whose name she
does not know. This is a very palpable hit, and tells amazingly.
The unknown benefactor of these unfortunates <em>incognito</em> is a young
<em>Mr. Heartall</em>, a wild, giddy character, that is, in the modern sense,
a person who never stands still on the stage—who is always running
into scrapes, which he walks out of without leaving any apology or
account behind him. Then there is the <em>Widow Cheerly</em>, in the same
house with the <em>Melfords</em>, whose heart and whose <em>ridicule</em> are ever
open to the distressed, and who makes a match with <em>Young Heartall</em>,
because he makes her an offer, it not being consistent with the
gallantry of a soldier’s daughter to decline a challenge of that sort.
Then there is <em>Old Heartall</em>, uncle to <em>Young Heartall</em>, and an East
Indian Governor, who says one thing and does another; calls his
nephew a scoundrel, and throws his arms round his neck. He is not
a character, but a contradiction. Then there is a Mr. Ferret, who
commits all sorts of unaccountable villainies through the piece, without
any ostensible motives, and at the end of it you find that he has
acted upon an abstract principle of avarice.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘If,’ he says, ‘there had been no such thing as avarice, I had not
been a villain.’ This is a very edifying confession of faith; and so
not finding this principle answer, he repents upon an abstract principle
of repentance, and also at the instigation of his old benefactor, (just
arrived from the East and accordingly a great moralist), who reads
him a great moral lecture, and advises him to give up his ill-gotten
gains. As <em>Mr. Ferret</em> submits to his advice backed by the law,
<em>Old Heartall</em> is prevailed on to forgive his designs upon the lives,
characters, and fortunes of his acquaintance, from an amiable weakness
of heart, and because the <em>Widow Cheerly</em>, who intercedes for him,
‘has roguish eyes.’ Mr. Liston plays a foolish servant in the
<em>Heartall</em> family, whose name is <em>Timothy</em>. The name of <em>Timothy</em> is
one of the jokes of this part: Mr. Liston’s face is the other, and the
best of the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole tone of this play reminded us strongly of a very
excellent criticism which we had read a short time before on the <em>cant</em>
of Modern Comedy, in one of the notes to Mr. Lamb’s Specimens of
Early Dramatic Poetry:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The insipid levelling morality to which the modern stage is tied
down would not admit of such admirable passions as these scenes are
filled with. A puritanical obtuseness of sentiment, a stupid infantile
goodness, is creeping among us, instead of the vigorous passions, and
virtues clad in flesh and blood, with which the old dramatists present
us. Those noble and liberal casuists could discern in the differences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the quarrels, the animosities of men, a beauty and truth of moral
feeling, no less than in the iteratively inculcated duties of forgiveness
and atonement. With us, all is hypocritical meekness. A reconciliation
scene (let the occasion be never so absurd and unnatural) is
always sure of applause. Our audiences come to the theatre to be
complimented on their goodness. They compare notes with the
amiable characters in the play, and find a wonderful similarity of
disposition between them. We have a common stock of dramatic
morality, out of which a writer may be supplied, without the trouble
of copying it from originals within his own breast. To know the
boundaries of honour—to be judiciously valiant—to have a temperance
which shall beget a smoothness in the angry swellings of youth—to
esteem life as nothing when the sacred reputation of a parent is to be
defended, yet to shake and tremble under a pious cowardice when
that ark of an honest confidence is found to be frail and tottering—to
feel the true blows of a real disgrace blunting that sword which the
imaginary strokes of a supposed false imputation had put so keen an
edge upon but lately—to do, or to imagine this done in a feigned
story, asks something more of a moral sense, somewhat a greater
delicacy of perception in questions of right and wrong, than goes to
the writing of two or three hackneyed sentences about the laws of
honour as opposed to the laws of the land or a common-place against
duelling. Yet such things would stand a writer now a days in far
better stead than Captain Ager and his conscientious honour; and he
would be considered as a far better teacher of morality than old
Rowley or Middleton, if they were living.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This theatre was opened for the present season under very favourable
auspices; and we congratulate the public on the prospect of the
continuance of this addition to the stock of elegant amusement.
Though the opera is not among the ordinary resources of the lovers
of the drama, it is a splendid object in the <em>vista</em> of a winter’s
evening, and we should be sorry to see it mouldering into decay, its
graceful columns and Corinthian capitals fallen, and its glory buried
in Chancery. We rejoice when the Muses escape out of the
fangs of the law, nor do we like to see the Graces arrested—in
a <i><span lang="fr">pas de trois</span></i>. We do not ‘like to see the unmerited fall of
what has long flourished in splendour; any void produced in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>the imagination; any ruin on the face of Art.’ At present we hope
better things from the known tastes and talents of the gentleman
who is understood to have undertaken the management of the
principal department, and from what we have seen of the performances
with which the company have commenced their career. The
pieces on Saturday and Tuesday were the Opera of <cite>Penelope</cite> by
Cimarosa, and the inimitable comic Ballet, <cite>The Dansomanie</cite>. The
first is, what it professes to be, a Grand Serious Opera: but it is
somewhat heavy and monotonous. It introduced to the English
Stage several actors of considerable eminence abroad. The principal
were Mad. Camporese as <em>Penelope</em>, Madame Pasta as <em>Telemachus</em>,
and Signor Crivelli as <em>Ulysses</em>. The last of these appears to be as
good an actor as a singer. His gestures have considerable appropriateness
and expression, besides having that sustained dignity and
studied grace, which are essential to the harmony of the Opera;
and his tones in singing are full, clear, and so articulate, that any
one at all imbued with the Italian language can follow the words
with ease. Madame Camporese performed <em>Penelope</em>, and drew down
the frequent plaudits of the house by the sweetness of her voice, and
the flexibility of execution which she manifested in some of the most
difficult and impassioned passages. If we were to express our
opinion honestly, we should say that we received most pleasure from
Madame Pasta’s <em>Telemachus</em>. There is a natural eloquence about her
singing which we feel, and therefore understand. Her dress and
figure also answered to the classical idea we have of the youthful
<em>Telemachus</em>. Her voice is good, her action is good: she has a
handsome face, and <em>very</em> handsome legs. The ladies, we know,
think otherwise: this is the only subject on which we think ourselves
better judges than they.—Of the <em>Dansomanie</em> we will say
nothing, lest we should be supposed to have caught the madness
which it ridicules so sportively and gracefully. The whole is
excellent, but the Minuet de la Cour is sublime: and the Gavot
which succeeds it, is as good. Madame Leon was exquisite, and
she had a partner worthy of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Southern’s tragedy of <cite>Oroonoko</cite>, which has not been acted, we
believe, for some years, has been brought forward here to introduce
Mr. Kean as the Royal Slave. It was well thought of. We consider
it as one of his best parts. It is also a proof to us of what
we have always been disposed to think, that Mr. Kean, when
he fully gives up his mind to it, is as great in pure pathos as in
energy of action or discrimination of character. In general, he
inclines to the violent and muscular expression of passion, rather than
to that of its deep, involuntary, heart-felt workings. If he does this
upon any theory of the former style of expression being more striking
and calculated to produce an immediate effect, we think the success
of his <cite>Richard II.</cite> and of this play alone (not to mention innumerable
fine passages in his other performances), might convince him of the
perfect safety with which he may trust himself in the hands of the
audience, whenever he chuses to indulge in ‘the melting mood.’
We conceive that the range of his powers is greater in this respect
than he has yet ventured to display, and that if the taste of the town
is not yet ripe for the change, he has genius enough to lead it,
wherever truth and nature point the way. His performance of
<cite>Oroonoko</cite> was for the most part decidedly of a mild and sustained
character; yet it was highly impressive throughout, and most so,
where it partook least of violence or effort. The strokes of passion
which came unlooked for and seemed to take the actor by surprise,
were those that took the audience by surprise, and only found relief
in tears. Of this kind was the passage in which, after having been
harrowed up to the last degree of agony and apprehension at the
supposed dishonourable treatment of his wife, and being re-assured
on that point, he falls upon her neck with sobs of joy and broken
laughter, saying, ‘I knew they could not,’ or words to that effect.
The first meeting between him and <em>Imoinda</em> was also very affecting;
and the transition to tenderness and love in it was even finer than
the expression of breathless eagerness and surprise. There were
many other passages in which the feelings, conveyed by the actor,
seemed to gush from his heart, as if its inmost veins had been laid
open. In a word, Mr. Kean gave to the part that glowing and
impetuous, and at the same time deep and full expression, which
belongs to the character of that burning zone, which ripens the souls
of men, as well as the fruits of the earth! The most striking part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>in the whole performance was in the uttering of a single word.
<cite>Oroonoko</cite>, in consequence of his gentle treatment, and the flattering
promises that are held out to him of safe conduct to his own country,
of the restoration of his liberty and his beloved <em>Imoinda</em>, thinks well
of the persons into whose hands he has fallen; and it is in vain
that <em>Aboam</em> (Mr. Rae) tries to work him up to suspicion and
revenge by general descriptions of the sufferings of his countrymen,
or of the cruelty and treachery of their white masters: but at the
suggestion of the thought, that if they remain where they are, <em>Imoinda</em>
will become the mother, and himself, a prince and a hero, the father
of a race of slaves, he starts and the manner in which he utters
the ejaculation ‘Hah!’ at the world of thought which is thus shewn
to him, like a precipice at his feet, resembles the first sound that
breaks from a thunder-cloud, or the hollow roar of a wild beast,
roused from its lair by hunger and the scent of blood. It is a pity
that the catastrophe does not answer to the grandeur of the menace;
and that this gallant vindicator of himself and his countrymen
fails in his enterprise, through the treachery and cowardice of
those whom he attempts to set free, but ‘who were by nature slaves!’
The story of this <em>servile war</em> is not without a parallel elsewhere:
it reads ‘a great moral lesson’ to Europe, only changing <em>black</em>
into <em>white</em>; and the manner in which <cite>Oroonoko</cite> is prevailed on
to give up his sword, and his treatment afterwards, by a man
in British uniform, seems to have been the model of the Convention
of Paris. It only required one thing to have made it complete, that
the Governor, who is expected in the island, should have arrived
in time to break the agreement, and save the credit of his subaltern.
The political allusions throughout, that is, the appeals to common
justice and humanity, against the most intolerable cruelty and
wrong, are so strong and palpable, that we wonder the piece is not
prohibited. There is that black renegade <em>Othman</em>, who betrays his
country in the hopes of promotion, and the favour of his betters: how
like he is to many a white-faced loon, but that ‘the devil has not
damned them black!’ Politics apart—<cite>Oroonoko</cite> is a very interesting
moral play. It is a little tedious sometimes, and a little common-place
at all times, but it has feeling and nature to supply what
it wants in other respects. The negroes in it (we could wish them
out of it, but then there would be no play) are very <em>ugly customers</em>
upon the stage. One blackamoor in a picture is an ornament, but a
whole cargo of them is more than enough. This play puts us out of
conceit with both colours, theirs and our own; the sooty slave’s,
and his cold, sleek, smooth-faced master’s.—Miss Somerville was a
great relief to the natural and moral deformity of the scene. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>looked like the <em>idea</em> of the poet’s mind. Her resigned, pensive,
unconscious look and attitude, at the moment she is about to be
restored to the rapturous embrace of her lover, was a beautiful
dramatic picture. She is an acquisition to the milder parts of
tragedy. She interests on the stage, for she is interesting in herself.
She cannot help being a heroine, if she but shews herself. She was as
elegantly dressed in <em>Imoinda</em>, for an Indian maid, in light, flowered
drapery, as she was in <em>Imogine</em>, for a lady of old romance, in
trains of lead-coloured satin. Her voice is sweet, but lost in
its own sweetness; and we who hear her at some distance, can
only catch ‘the music of her honey-vows,’ like the indistinct
murmur of a hive of bees. Mr. Bengough does not improve upon
us by acquaintance. All that we have of late discovered in
him is that he has grey eyes. Little Smith made an excellent
representative of the coasting Guinea captain. John Bull could not
desire to have better justice done to his mind or his body.—Southern,
the author of <cite>Oroonoko</cite>, was also the author of <cite>Isabella,
or the Fatal Marriage</cite>, in both of which ‘he often has beguiled us
of our tears.’ He died at the age of eighty-six, in 1746. Gray,
the poet, speaks thus of him in a letter, dated from Burnham, in
Buckinghamshire, 1737. ‘We have here old Mr. Southern, at
a gentleman’s house a little way off: he is now seventy-seven
years old, and has almost wholly lost his memory: but is as agreeable
as an old man can be: at least I persuade myself so, when I
look at him, and think of <cite>Isabella</cite> and <cite>Oroonoko</cite>.’</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been little new this week. A new after-piece or melo-drame
has been brought forward at Covent-garden, and the old farce
of the <cite>Pannel</cite> revived at Drury-Lane. We can say but little in praise
of the former, except the excellence of the acting and the manner
in which it is got up. The strength of the house is mustered in a
second-rate production, and from the list of names in the play-bills,
the public go to see the performers, if not the performance, and come
away at least half satisfied. They manage these things differently at
Drury-lane, and not so well. We deny that the comic strength of
the two houses is so unequal as is sometimes supposed. For instance,
at Drury-lane, they have Munden, Dowton, Oxberry, and Knight;
Harley is droll too; and in women, they beat them out and out, for
they have Miss Kelly. To be sure, they have not Liston; so they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>must kick the beam. Mr. Liston is the greatest comic genius of the
age. If we were very dull and sad indeed, we should avoid going to
any farce or comedy in which he did not appear, as only tantalising
to our feelings, and promising relief without affording it: but we
must be dull indeed, if we did not bite at the bait of Mr. Liston’s
<cite>Lubin Log</cite>. His comic humour is a sort of oil or ‘balsam of fierabras’
for all imaginary wounds that are not a foot deep. His laugh might
tickle royalty itself after the howling of the rabble, or make one of
the wax figures at Mrs. Salmon’s relax from the inflexibility of its
state. Then there is Miss Stephens at Covent-garden, and there
are the three Miss Dennets—like ‘Circe and the Sirens three.’ We
always see the Miss Dennets at the theatre, and they sometimes glide
before our imagination at other times; but we seldom hear Miss
Stephens now. We want to see her again in <cite>Mandane</cite>, in which we
have seen her eight times already, and to hear her sing <cite>If o’er the
cruel tyrant Love</cite>, which we could hear her sing for ever. We want
to see her in <cite>Polly</cite> for the seventh time, and in <cite>Rosetta</cite> for the fifth,
we believe it will be, when we see her in it again, which will be when
she next plays in it. Pray how long will it be first, Mr. Fawcett?
We suppose not till Miss O’Neill is tired of tiring the audience in
<cite>Mrs. Oakley</cite>, or ‘the ravens are hoarse that croak over Mr. Emery’s
head’ in the Pangs of Conscience. <em>Something new, always something
new.</em> That is the taste of Covent Garden, and the town. It is not
our’s. We are for something old. <i><span lang="fr">Toujours perdrix.</span></i> We like to read
the same books, and to see the same plays, and the same faces over
again—<em>always provided</em> we liked them at first. Now there is one
face which we never liked, and never shall like, which is the face of
Tyranny, and the older it gets, the uglier it gets in our eyes, and in
this, as a matter of taste, we differ entirely with Mr. Canning, though
he has been declared by a classical authority to be ‘the most elegant
mind since Virgil.’ We differ with him notwithstanding.—<cite>The
Ravens, or the Pangs of Conscience</cite>, is a melo-drame taken from the
French, of the same breed, but an inferior specimen, as the <cite>Maid and
Magpie</cite>, and the <cite>Family of Anglade</cite>. It is a kind of renewal of the
age of augury adapted to the modern theories of probability, by being
reduced within the limits of natural history. These pieces take for
their text the lines,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And choughs and magpies shall bring forth</div>
      <div class='line'>The secret’st man of blood.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the <cite>Pangs of Conscience</cite>, as in the <cite>Maid of Palisseau</cite>, there is a
robbery, a trial of persons innocently suspected of it, and a discovery
of the real perpetrators, just at the critical moment, by the intervention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>of two of the feathered creation. Just as sentence has been
pronounced on the supposed criminals (Terry and Blanchard) by the
Judge, (Barrymore, who really performed this character admirably)
two Ravens fly in upon the stage, the same who had hovered over
the scene of the murder and robbery in the adjacent forest, and by
their silent but dreadful appeal to the conscience of <em>Jacques du Noir</em>
(Emery), who is not like his cousin <em>Bruno du Noir</em> (poor Farley)
a hardened, but a conscientious villain, reveal the mystery of the
whole transaction, by which the guilty are punished, and the innocent
miraculously escape.—There was some fine and powerful acting by
Emery in the part of the repentant assassin. <em>Bruno</em> in vain endeavours
to appease and quiet him, but he still roars out lustily to give vent
both to the pangs of his conscience and the ‘grief of a wound’ which
he has got in the encounter from an old rusty fowling-piece of
Fawcett’s, whom they plunder and kill. The greatest part of this
romantic fiction is tedious, and the whole of it improbable, but from
the goodness of the acting, and some strokes of interest in the situations,
it went off with applause. Of the <em>Pannel</em>, we have only room
to add that we think <em>Beatrice</em>, who is the subordinate heroine of the
piece, the best specimen of Mrs. Alsop’s acting. We saw it from a
remote part of the house, and her <em>voice and manner</em> at this distance
sometimes reminded us of her mother’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Dowton advertised for his benefit that he was to appear
in the after-piece as <cite>John Gilpin</cite>, and to ride for that night only, we
immediately felt tempted to go as the self-appointed executors and
residuary legatees of the original author of the story, who concludes
his account with these two lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And when he next does ride abroad,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>May we be there to see.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>So we took upon us to fulfil Cowper’s wish, and went to see, not
<cite>John Gilpin</cite>, nor, as we are credibly informed, even Mr. Dowton,
but something very laughable, and still more absurd, which had however
a certain charm about it, from the very name of the hero of the
piece. We have an interest in <cite>John Gilpin</cite>; aye, almost as great an
interest as we have in ourselves; for we remember him almost as
long. We remember the prints of him and his travels hung round a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>little parlour where we used to visit when we were children—just
about the time of the beginning of the French Revolution. While
the old ladies were playing at whist, and the young ones at forfeits,
we crept about the sides of the room and tracked <cite>John Gilpin</cite> from
his counter to his horse, from his own door to the turnpike, and far
beyond the turnpike gate and the bell at Edmonton, with loss of wig
and hat, but with an increasing <em>impetus</em> and reputation, the farther he
went from home.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The turnpike men their gates wide open threw,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He carries weight, he rides a race,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>What an impression was here made, never to be effaced! What a
thing it is to be an author, and how much better a thing it is to be a
reader, with all the pleasure and without any of the trouble—but
without any of the fame, you will say. That is not worth two-pence.
And yet true fame is something, the fame, for instance, of Cowper or
of Thomson—not to live in the mouths of pedants, and coxcombs,
and professional men, but in the heart and soul of every living being,
to mingle with every thought, to beat in every pulse, to be hailed
with transport by those who are young, and to be remembered with
regret by those who are old, to be ‘first, last, and midst’ in the
minds of others. True fame is like a Lapland sun, that never goes
down; it rises with us in the morning, and rolls round and round till
our night of life. Why, look here, what a thing it is to be an author!
<cite>John Gilpin</cite> delighted us when we were children, and were we to die
to-morrow, the name of <cite>John Gilpin</cite> would excite a momentary sense
of pleasure. The same feeling of delight, with which at ten years
old we read the story, makes us thirty years after go, laughing, to see
the play. In all that time, the remembrance has been cherished at
the heart, like the pulse that sustains our life. ‘That ligament, fine
as it was, was never broken!’ and yet it was nearly broken the other
night, in the after-piece of this name, and would have been quite so
for the evening, if it had not been for Mr. Munden, who, as a subordinate
agent, prevented Mr. Dowton from breaking his neck in the
principal character. We differed from the audience on this occasion,
who did not much relish Mr. Munden in his part of a cockney: we
relished him altogether and mightily. His speech, his countenance,
and his dress, were in high costume and keeping. There was a greatness
of gusto about <em>Timothy Brittle</em>, <em>Mrs. Gilpin’s</em> favourite but
unfortunate son-in-law. It might be said of Mr. Munden in this
character, that not only did his dress appear to have come fresh from
the shop-board, his coat, his pantaloons, his waistcoat—but his speech
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>was clipped and snipped as with a pair of sheers, and his face
looked just as if the tailor’s goose had gone over it. It was a fine
and inimitable piece of acting, but it was damned.—Dowton, in <cite>The
Rivals</cite>, played <em>Mrs. Malaprop</em>, and Mrs. Sparks played <em>Sir Anthony
Absolute</em>. We cannot say much of these transformations, for the
performers themselves remained just the same, breeches and petticoats
out of the question; nothing was transformed or ridiculous but
their dress. Dowton was as blunt and bluff, and Mrs. Sparks was
as keen, querulous, and scolding, as in any of their usual characters.
The effect was flat after the first <i><span lang="fr">entrée</span></i>, and the whole play was, in
other respects, very poorly got up;—quite in the comic <i><span lang="it">negligé</span></i> of
<em>Drury-lane</em>.—We ought to say something of Mrs. Hill, who came
out on Tuesday evening as <em>Lady Macbeth</em>. She is neither a good
nor a bad actress. She has, however, a sentimental drawl in her
voice and manner which is very little to our taste, and not at all in
character as <em>Lady Macbeth</em>. The King never dies. Why should
Mrs. Siddons ever die? Why, because Kings are fictions in law:
Mrs. Siddons was one of nature’s greatest works.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last time we saw the Opera of <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> was from a distant
part of the house: we saw it the other evening near; and as the
impression was somewhat different, we wish to correct one or two
things in our former statement. Madame Fodor sings and acts the
part of <em>Zerlina</em> as charmingly as ever, but she does not <em>look</em> it so well
near as at a greater distance. She has too much <i><span lang="la">em bon point</span></i>, is too
broad-set for the idea of a young and beautiful country girl: her
mouth is laughing and good-natured, but does not answer to Spenser’s
description of <em>Belphebe</em>,—and it cannot be concealed that <em>Zerlina</em>, the
delightful Zerlina, has a cast in her eyes. Her singing, however,
made us forget all these defects, and after the second line of <cite>La ci
darem</cite>, we had quite recovered from our disappointment. On the
whole, we at present prefer the air of <cite>Vedrai Carino</cite>, which she sings
to <em>Masetto</em> to comfort him, even to the duet with <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>.
There was some uncertainty about <em>encoring</em> her in this song,—not,
we apprehend, because the audience were afraid of tiring the actress,
but because they were tired themselves. Madame Fodor was <em>encored</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>in all her songs throughout the piece.—This might be thought hard
upon her; we dare say she would have thought it harder if she had
not. Signor Ambrogetti’s acting as <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> improves upon a
nearer acquaintance. There is a softness approaching to effeminacy
in the expression of his face, which accords well with the character,
and an insinuating archness in his eye, which takes off from the violent
effect of his action. The serenade of <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> was omitted.
As to Naldi, he is in too confirmed possession of the stage to be
corrigible to advice. He is one of those old birds that are not to
be caught with chaff. The sly rogue, <em>Leporello</em>, seems to have grown
grey in the service of iniquity, and hangs his nose over the stage with
a formidable <i><span lang="it">bravura</span></i> aspect, as if he could suspend the orchestra
from it. Angrisani is an admirable, and we might say, first-rate
comic actor. He has fine features; a manly, rustic voice; and we
never saw disdain, impatience, the resentment and relenting of the
jealous lover, better expressed than in the scene between him and
Madame Fodor, where she makes that affecting appeal to his forgiveness
in the song of <cite>Batte, Batte, Masetto</cite>. It was inimitably acted
on both sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kean has appeared in <cite>Eustace de St. Pierre</cite> in the <cite>Surrender
of Calais</cite>. He has little to do in it; and he might as well not have
appeared in the character, for he does not look well in it. He was
badly dressed in a doublet of green baize, and in villainous yellow
hose. It was like the player’s description of Hecuba—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

this part; but it afforded less scope and fewer opportunities for them
than any part in which we have ever seen him. We are not sorry,
however, that he has got into the part, as a kind of truce with tragedy.
Why should he not, like other actors, sometimes have a part to walk
through? Must we for ever be expecting from him, as if he were a
little <i><span lang="la">Jupiter tonans</span></i>, ‘thunder, nothing but thunder?’ It is too much
for any mortal to play <em>Othello</em> and <em>Sir Giles</em> in the same week—we
mean, as Mr. Kean plays them. He is, we understand, to appear in
a new character, and sing a new song, for his benefit to-morrow week.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>‘Here be truths.’—<cite>Dogberry.</cite></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>First, there is an old woman in the neighbouring village, fifty-six
years old, with a wooden leg, who never saw a leg of mutton roasted,
or a piece of beef put into the pot; and who regards any person who
has not lived all his life on rusty bacon as a non-descript or ‘mountain
foreigner.’ Yet this venerable matron, who now officiates as cook to
a lady ‘retired from public haunts’ into a remote part of the country,
kept her father’s house, who was a little farmer, for twenty years;
so that she ranks, in the scale of rural existence, above her neighbours.
What then must the notions of most of them be of the <i><span lang="fr">savoir vivre</span></i>?
Is this the sum and substance of all our boasts of the roast-beef of old
England?—The truth is, that the people in this part of the country
(I do not know how it is in others) have neither food nor cloathing
wherewith to be content; nor are they content without them, nor
with those that have them. Any one dressed in a plain broad-cloth
coat is in their eyes a sophisticated character, as outlandish a figure
as my <em>Lord Foppington</em>. A smock-frock, and shoes with hob-nails
in them, are an indispensable part of country etiquette; and they
hoot at or pelt any one, who is presumptuous enough to depart from
this appropriate costume. This, if we may believe a philosophical
poet of the present day, is the meaning of the phrase in Shakespear,
‘pelting villages,’ he having been once set upon in this manner by
‘a crew of patches, rude mechanicals,’ who disliked him for the
fantastic strangeness of his appearance. Even their tailors (of whom
you might expect better things) hate decency, and will spoil you a
suit of clothes, rather than follow your directions. One of them,
the little hunch-backed tailor of P—tt—n, with the handsome
daughter, whose husband ran away from her and went to sea, was
ordered to make a pair of brown or snuff-coloured breeches for my
friend C—— L——;—instead of which the pragmatical old gentleman
(having an opinion of his own) brought him home a pair of
‘lively Lincoln-green,’ in which I remember he rode in triumph in
Johnny Tremain’s cross-country caravan through Newberry, and
entered Oxford, ‘fearing no colours,’ the abstract idea of the jest
of the thing prevailing in his mind (as it always does) over the sense
of personal dignity.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a stranger comes to live among country people, they have a bad
opinion of him at first; and all he can do to overcome their dislike,
only confirms them in it. It is in vain to attempt to conciliate them:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the more you strive to persuade them that you mean them no harm,
the more they are determined not to be convinced. They attribute
any civility or kindness you shew them to a design to cajole them.
They are not to be taken in by appearances. They are <i><span lang="la">feræ naturæ</span></i>,
and not to be tamed by art. In proportion as you give them no cause
of offence, they summon their whole stock of prejudice, impudence,
and cunning, to aid their tottering opinion; and hate you the more
for the injustice they seem to do you. They had rather you did
them an injury that they might keep their original opinion of you.
If there is the smallest circumstance or insinuation to your prejudice,
their rancour against you, and self-complacency in their own sagacity,
eagerly seizes hold of it; fans their suspicions into a flame, and breaks
out into open insult and all the triumph of brutal derision. On the
contrary, if they find you, after all, a quiet, inoffensive person, they
think you a fool, and so have you that way. Used to contempt,
they have not much respect to spare for other people. Finding
themselves none the better for them, they have not much faith in
your demonstrations of good-will towards them. Prepared for
repulses and hard treatment, the expression of their gratitude is not
very spontaneous or sincere.—An aged Sybil of this place, having
gone to a lady, who had just settled here, with a doleful tale of
distress, and an empty bottle, received a shilling instead of having
her bottle replenished with liquor; when being met on her return
by one of her gossips coming on the same errand, and being asked
her success, she held up her empty bottle in sign of scorn, saying,
‘Look here!’ Such is the <i><span lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i> of unsophisticated human
nature in her obscure retreats, about which there have been so many
‘songs of delight and rustical roundelays.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it strange that these people who know nothing, hate all that
they do not understand? Their rudeness, intolerance, and conceit,
are in exact proportion to their ignorance: for as they never saw or
scarcely heard of any thing out of their own village, every thing else
appears to them odd and unaccountable, and they cannot suspect that
their own notions are wrong, when they are totally unacquainted
with any others. We naturally despise whatever baffles our comprehension,
and dislike what contradicts our prejudices, till we are
taught better by a liberal course of study; but these people are no
better taught than fed. It is a rule which they act upon as self-evident,
and from which you will not get them to flinch in a hurry—to
scout every proceeding which differs from their own, and to
consider every person, of whose birth, parentage, and education, they
do not know the several particulars, as a suspicious character. They
have no knowledge of literature or the fine arts; which, if once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>banished from the city and the court, would soon ‘be trampled in
the mire under the hoofs of a swinish multitude.’ A mischievous
wag of the present day undertook to read some pastoral and lyrical
effusions, (remarkable for their simplicity) to a collection of Cumberland
peasants, to see if they would recognise the sentiments put into
their mouths; and they only (which was what he expected) laughed
at him for his pains. ‘The spinsters and the knitters in the sun, and
the free maids that weave their thread with bones,’ may indeed
relieve the welcome pedlar of his wares, his laces, his true love-knots,
or penny-Ballads, but they will have nothing to say to the Lyrical
ballads, nor will the united counties of Westmorland, Cumberland,
and Durham, subscribe to lighten the London warehouses of a single
copy of the <cite>Excursion</cite>. The hewers of wood and drawers of water
know nothing of poetry, and they hate the very look of a poet.
They like a painter as little. An artist who was making a sketch
of a fine old yew tree in a romantic situation, was asked by a <em>knowing
hand</em>, if he could tell how many foot of timber it contained? <em>Falstaff</em>
asks as a question not to be answered—‘May I not take mine ease
at mine inn?’ But this was in East-Cheap. I cannot do so in the
country; for while I am writing this, I hear a fellow disputing in
the kitchen, whether a person ought to live (as he expresses it) by
pen and ink; and the landlord the other day (in order, I suppose,
the better to prepare himself for such controversies) asked me if I
had any object in reading through all those books which I had
brought with me, meaning a few odd volumes of old plays and
novels. The people born here cannot tell how an author gets his
living or passes his time; and would fain hunt him out of the place
as they do a strange dog, or as they formerly did a conjuror or a
witch. Ask the first country clown you meet, if he ever heard
of Shakespear or Newton, and he will stare in your face: and I
remember our laughing a good deal at W——’s old Molly, who
had never heard of the French Revolution, ten years after it happened.
Oh worse than Gothic ignorance!</p>

<p class='c007'>They have no books, nor ever feel the want of them. How
indeed should they?<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a> They have no works of poetry or fiction, to
‘fleet the golden time carelessly;’ but they do not therefore want
for fabulous resources. Necessity is the mother of invention; and
their talent for lying and scandal is nourished by the very lack of
materials.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a> They live not by bread alone, but by every word that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>proceedeth out of their mouths. They are employed, like the
Athenians of old, in hearing or telling some new thing. The draw-well
is the source from which they pump up idle rumours, and the
blacksmith’s shop is the place at which they forge the proofs, and
turn them to shape, ‘giving to airy nothing a local habitation and a
name.’ They lie like devils through thick and thin. They tell
and believe all incredible things; and the greater the improbability,
the more readily and greedily is it swallowed, for it imposes more
on the imagination. <em>To elevate and surprise</em> is the great rule for
producing a theatrical or pastoral effect. People in a state of nature
believe any thing for want of something to divert the mind, as they
plot mischief for want of better employment. Credulity and imposture
are two of the strongest propensities of the human mind. Men
are as prone to deceive themselves as others, without any other
temptation than the exercise it affords to the imagination. It is a
false test of historical evidence, that it is necessary to assign a motive
why men should consent to be dupes or undertake to be cheats.
Curiosity is the source of superstition; for we must have objects to
occupy the attention, and fill up the craving void of knowledge; and
in the absence of truth, falsehood is called in to supply its place, and
with the gross and ignorant, supplies it much better. To ask why
the untutored savage believes every marvellous story that is told him,
in the dearth of all real knowledge, is to ask why he slakes his
thirst at the first fountain that he meets, or devours the prey he has
just taken. With all their tendency to bigotry and superstition,
country people have scarcely any idea of religion. They have as
little divine as human learning. The Bible is the only book they
have, but that they do not read, except with spectacles, when they
grow old and half-blind. They are to a man and woman of <em>Mrs.
Quickly’s</em> opinion—‘But I told him a’ should not think of God yet.’
They go to church, to be sure, as a matter of course, and from not
knowing what else to do with themselves on Sundays; but they
never think of what they hear, from one week’s end to another.
Heaven and Hell are out-of-the-way places, not accessible to the
apprehensions of those whose ideas cannot get beyond the parish
where they were born; and their joys or sorrows indifferent to an
imagination, taken up with the wants of the belly. An old woman,
who lived in a cottage by herself, on hearing the account of the
Crucifixion, said it was a sad thing, but she hoped it was not true,
as it happened so far off and such a long time ago. A servant girl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>hearing a Sermon read in which there was a striking account of the
Resurrection and the Day of Judgment, was very much alarmed, and
said she hoped it would not be in her time. The Decalogue has no
terrors, and the Book of Revelations no charms for them. They
will be damned, but they will steal and lie, and bear false witness
against each other; or if they do not, it is the fear of being hanged,
or whipped, or summoned before the Justice of the Peace, and not
of being called to account in another world, that prevents them.
They are of the earth, earthy. They take thought only for the
morrow; or rather, conform to the text—‘Sufficient to the day is
the evil thereof.’ There is not a greater mistake, or a more wilful
fallacy, than the common observation, that the lower orders are kept
in order (and can only be so) by their faith in religion. They have
no more belief in it practically than most of their betters, who propose
to keep them in order by it, have speculatively. The ignorant and
destitute are restrained from certain things by the fear of the law, or
of what will be said of them by their neighbours; and as to other
things which are denounced by Scripture, but to which no penalty
attaches here, they think if they have a mind to do them, and chuse
to go to hell for it, they have a right to do so. That is their phrase.
It is nobody’s business but their own. It is (generally speaking)
the absence of temptation or opportunity, and not an excess of
religious apprehension, that keeps them within the pale of salvation.
Their self-will balances their fear of the Devil, and when it comes to
the push, the present motive turns the scale, and the flesh proves too
hard for the spirit. Burns’s old man in the <cite>Cottar’s Saturday Night</cite>
must pass for a very poetical character, at least in this part of the
country. We see constant accounts in the papers, in the case of
malefactors that have come to an untimely end, that it was owing in
the first instance to the want of religion, to the habit of swearing and
Sabbath-breach. The same account would hold equally true of those
who are not hanged: for if all but the godly and sober among the
lower classes came to the gallows, the population would soon be
thinned to a surprising degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the regular church-going peasantry, there can be no great
difference as to religious light and feelings between them and their
forefathers in the time of Popery, when the service was performed
in Latin, as it is at present in most foreign countries. The only
religious people (except as a matter of outward shew and ceremony)
are sectaries; for the instant religion becomes a subject for serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>thought and private reflection, it produces differences of opinion,
which branch out into as many speculative fancies and forms of
worship, as there are differences of temper or accidents of education.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
This, however, is the exception, not the rule, in the present state of
things—now that zeal is no longer kindled at the fires of persecution,
and that Acts of Uniformity no longer throw the whole country
into a ferment of opposition. The missionaries and fanatics sometimes
indeed set up a methodist chapel, where the staid inhabitants go
in an evening to spite the parson of the parish, or to while away an
hour or so; or perhaps a melancholy mechanic has a serious call
and holds forth, or a pining spinster, moved by the spirit to listen
to him—</p>

  </div>

<p class='c016'>but the younger and healthier sort make a sport of it as of any other
fantastical innovation; throw owls and skeletons of kites and carrion
crows into the place of worship; and make a violent noise all the
time the parson is preaching, to drown the nasal twang of evangelical
glad-tidings, and the comfortable groans of the faithful.—All this
while there is no end of the bastard-getting and swearing: and a girl,
after having had three or four children by the same man, or by different
men (as it happens), and who is as big as she can tumble again, is at
length asked in church, without much scandal or offence to the
community. It is a new topic for the village, and is excused on that
account. It is, besides, an evidence quashed; and whatever others
may take it into their heads to do, she need not talk. Liberality
flourishes; a good example is set; and the species is propagated with
as little trouble and formality as possible. The parson gets something
by the christening, and the apothecary has a finger in the pie.
This is a state of things which ought to be reformed—but how or
when?</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Macready’s <cite>Macbeth</cite>, which he had for his benefit, and which he
has played once or twice since, is a judicious and spirited performance.
But we are not in the number of those who think it his finest character.
Sensibility, not imagination, is his <em>forte</em>. Natural expression,
human feeling, seems to woo him like a bride; but the <em>ideal</em> and
preternatural beckon him only at a distance and mock his embraces.
He sees no dim, portentous visions in his mind’s eye; his acting has
no shadowy landscape back-ground to surround it; he is not waited on
by spirits of the deep or of the air; neither fate nor metaphysical aid
are in league with him; he is prompter to himself, and treads within
the circle of the human heart. The machinery in <cite>Macbeth</cite> is so far
lost upon him: there is no secret correspondence between him and
the Weird Sisters. The poet has put a fruitless sceptre in his hand,—a
curtain is between him and the ‘air-drawn dagger with its gouts
of blood’; he does not cower under the traditions of the age, or
startle at ‘thick-coming fancies.’ He is more like a man debating
the reality, or questioning the power of the grotesque and unimaginable
forms that hover round him, than one hurried away by his credulous
hopes, or shrinking from intolerable fears. There is not a weight of
superstitious terror loading the atmosphere and hanging over the stage
when Mr. Macready plays the part. He has cast the cumbrous
slough of Gothic tragedy, and comes out a mere modern, agitated by
common means and intelligible motives. The preternatural agency is
no more than an accompaniment, the pretended occasion, not the
indispensable and all-powerful cause. It appears to us then, that this
excellent and able actor, <em>struck short</em> of the higher and imaginative
part of the character, and consequently was deficient in the human
passion, which is the mighty appendage to it. We thought Mr.
Macready in a manner conscious of this want of entire possession of
the character. He was looking out for new readings, transposing
attitudes and stage effects, trying substitutes and experiments, studying
passages instead of reciting them, rehearsing <cite>Macbeth</cite>, not <em>being</em> it.
His performance of it was critical and fastidious: you would say that
he was considering how he should act the part, so as to avoid certain
errors or produce certain effects—not that he ever flung himself into
the subject, and swam to shore, safe from carping objection, and above
the reach of all praise. Mr. Macready does not often imitate other
actors, but he endeavours not to imitate them, and that’s almost as
bad. He should think of nothing but his part, and rely on nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>but his own powers. Singularity is not excellence. If to follow in
the track of others shews a servile genius and pitiful ambition, neither
is it right to go out of the strait road merely because others travel in
it—‘but still to follow nature is the rule’—John Kemble was the
best <cite>Macbeth</cite> (upon the whole) that we have seen. There was a
stiff, horror-stricken stateliness in his person and manner, like a man
bearing up against supernal influences; and a bewildered distraction,
a perplexity and at the same time a rigidity of purpose, like one who
had been stunned by a blow from fate. Mr. Kean is great only in one
scene, that after the murder of <em>Duncan</em>; his acting also consists only
in the direct embodying of human passion, and is entirely ‘docked
and curtailed’ of the sweeping train of poetical imagination. On the
evening we saw Mr. Macready’s <cite>Macbeth</cite> Mrs. Faucit played <em>Lady
Macbeth</em>, and acted up to that arduous part with great spirit and self-possession;
and Mr. Terry was the representative of <em>Macduff</em>. The
only fault of this gentleman’s acting is its slowness. The words fall
from his lips, like pendent drops from icicles. A speech, as he gives
it, is equal to ‘twa lang Scotch miles.’ This not only causes a stagnation
and heaviness in the sentiments, but often cuts the sense in two.
Thus in the exclamation which <em>Macduff</em> utters on hearing of the
slaughter of his children, ‘Oh Hell-Kite, all?’ Mr. Terry paused
at the hyphen, as if to take time to think, and by this means made it
like an apostrophe to ‘Hell,’ adding the other syllable of the word,
which determined the meaning and direction of his thoughts, afterwards.
Mr. Egerton as usual played <em>Banquo</em>, and makes as solid a
Ghost as we would wish to encounter of a winter’s eve.</p>

<p class='c007'>David Rizzio we have not been able to get a peep at: but a friend
whispered us that it was poor, and we see it is praised in the <cite>New
Times</cite>!</p>

<p class='c007'>On Friday Miss Stephens had a bumper for her benefit. The
entertainments were the <cite>Lord of the Manor</cite>, a Concert, and the
<cite>Libertine</cite>. In the first, Mr. Duruset from indisposition, and after
making one feeble effort, omitted the songs, by the indulgence of the
audience; after that, we do not see why he should be required to go
through the rest of the part, for he has not ‘a speaking face.’ Jones’s
<em>Mr. Contrast</em> is a striking, fulsome fop. But he makes foppery not
only an object of laughter, but of disgust; and perhaps this is going
beyond the mark intended. We would recommend to our readers to
go and see Mr. Liston’s <em>Moll Flagon</em> by all means. It is irresistible.
We may say of it with the poet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let those laugh now who never laugh’d before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And those who still have laugh’d now laugh the more.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Mrs. Salmon’s singing in the Concert was ‘d’une pathétique à faire
fendre les rochers,’—and Miss Stephens’s Echo song seemed sung by
a Spirit or an enchantress. We were glad to hear it, for we have an
attachment to Miss Stephens on account of ‘auld lang syne’ (we like
old friendships better than new), and do not wish that little murmuring
syren Miss Tree to wean us from our old and artless favourite.—Those
were happy days when first Miss Stephens began to sing!
When she came out in <cite>Mandane</cite>, in <cite>Polly</cite>, and in <cite>Rosetta</cite> in <cite>Love in
a Village</cite>! She came upon us by surprise, but it was to delight and
charm us. There was a new sound in the air, like the voice of
Spring; it was as if Music had become young again, and was resolved
to try the power of her softest, simplest, sweetest notes. Love and
Hope listened, as her clear, liquid throat poured its delicious warblings
on the ear, and at the close of every strain, still called on Echo
to prolong the sound. They were the sweetest notes we ever heard,
and almost the last we ever heard with pleasure! For since then,
other events not to be named lightly here, but ‘thoughts of which can
never from the heart’—‘with other notes than to the Orphean lyre,’
have stopped our ears to the voice of the charmer. But since the
voice of Liberty has risen once more in Spain, its grave and its birth
place, and like a babbling hound has wakened the echos in Galicia, in
the Asturias, in Castile and Leon, and Estremadura, why, we feel as
if we ‘had three ears again’ and the heart to use them, and as if we
could once more write with the same feelings (the tightness removed
from the breast, and the pains smoothed from the brow) as we did
when we gave the account of Miss Stephens’s first appearance in the
<cite>Beggar’s Opera</cite>. Life might then indeed ‘know the return of
spring,’—and end, as it began, with faith in human kind!—</p>

<p class='c007'>Guy Faux is made into the figure of a scare-crow, a fifth of
November bugbear, in our history. Now that Mr. Hogg’s <cite>Jacobite
Relics</cite> have dissipated the remains of an undue horror at Popery,
it may seem the time to undertake the defence of so illustrious
a character, who has hitherto been the victim of party-prejudice and
national spite. Guy Faux was a Popish Priest in the reign of
James <span class='fss'>I.</span>, and for his unsuccessful attempt to set fire to the House
of Lords, and blow up the English Monarchy, the Protestant
Religion, and himself, at one stroke, has had the honour to be
annually paraded through the streets, and burnt in effigy in every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>town and village in England from that time to this—that is, for the
space of two hundred years and upwards. It is sometimes doubtful,
indeed, from the coincidence of dates and other circumstances,
whether this annual ceremony, accompanied as it is with the ringing
of bells, the firing of guns, and the preaching of sermons, is intended
more to revive the formidable memory of ‘poor Guy,’ or in celebration
of the glorious landing of William III., who came to deliver
us from Popery and Slavery a hundred years afterwards—two
things which Mr. Hogg treats as mere <em>bagatelles</em> in his <cite>Jacobite
Relics</cite>, though they do not appear so in the History of England;
and to which the same writer assures us, as an agreeable piece of
court-news that the present Family are by no means averse in their
hearts!</p>

<p class='c007'>Guy Faux was a fanatic, but he was no hypocrite. He ranks
among <em>good haters</em>. He was cruel, bloody-minded, reckless of all
considerations but those of an infuriated and bigotted faith; but he
was a true son of the Catholic Church, a martyr and a confessor,
for all that. He who can prevail upon himself to devote his life
for a cause, however we may condemn his opinions or abhor his
actions, vouches at least for the honesty of his principles and the
disinterestedness of his motives. He may be guilty of the worst
practices, but he is capable of the greatest. He is no longer a
slave, but free. The contempt of death is the beginning of virtue.
The hero of the Gun-Powder Plot was, if you will, a fool, a madman,
an assassin; call him what names you please: still he was
neither knave nor coward. He did not propose to blow up the Parliament
and come off, scot-free, himself: he shewed that he valued his
own life no more than theirs in such a cause—where the integrity
of the Catholic faith and the salvation of perhaps millions of
souls was at stake. He did not call it a murder, but a sacrifice
which he was about to achieve: he was armed with the Holy Spirit
and with fire: he was the Church’s chosen servant and her blessed
martyr. He comforted himself as ‘the best of cut-throats.’ How
many wretches are there that would have undertaken to do what he
intended for a sum of money, if they could have got off with impunity!
How few are there who would have put themselves in Guy
Faux’s situation to save the universe! Yet in the latter case we
affect to be thrown into greater consternation than at the most
unredeemed acts of villany, as if the absolute disinterestedness of the
motive doubled the horror of the deed! The cowardice and selfishness
of mankind are in fact shocked at the consequences to themselves
(if such examples are held up for imitation,) and they make a
fearful outcry against the violation of every principle of morality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>lest they too should be called on for any such tremendous sacrifices—lest
they in their turn should have to go on the forlorn hope
of extra-official duty. <em>Charity begins at home</em>, is a maxim that
prevails as well in the courts of conscience as in those of prudence.
We would be thought to shudder at the consequences of crime to
others, while we tremble for them to ourselves. We talk of the
dark and cowardly assassin; and this is well, when an individual
shrinks from the face of an enemy, and purchases his own safety
by striking a blow in the dark: but how the charge of cowardly
can be applied to the public assassin, who, in the very act of destroying
another, lays down his life as a pledge and forfeit of his sincerity
and boldness, I am at a loss to devise. There may be barbarous
prejudice, rooted hatred, unprincipled treachery, in such an act; but
he who resolves to take all the danger and odium upon himself, can
no more be branded with cowardice, than Regulus devoting himself
for his country, or Codrus leaping into the fiery gulf. A wily Father
Inquisitor, coolly and with plenary authority condemning hundreds of
helpless and unoffending victims to the flames or to the horrors of a
living tomb, while he himself would not suffer a hair of his head
to be hurt, is to me a character without any qualifying trait in it.
Again; the Spanish conqueror and hero, the favourite of his
monarch, who enticed thirty thousand poor Mexicans into a
large open building, under promise of strict faith and cordial
good-will, and then set fire to it, making sport of the cries and
agonies of these deluded creatures, is an instance of uniting the
most hardened cruelty with the most heartless selfishness. His
plea was keeping no faith with heretics: this was Guy Faux’s too;
but I am sure at least that the latter kept faith with himself: he was
in earnest in his professions. <em>His</em> was not gay, wanton, unfeeling
depravity; he did not murder in sport; it was serious work that he
had taken in hand. To see this arch-bigot, this heart-whole traitor,
this pale miner in the infernal regions, skulking in his retreat with his
cloak and dark lanthorn, moving cautiously about among his barrels
of gunpowder, loaded with death, but not yet ripe for destruction,
regardless of the lives of others, and more than indifferent to his
own, presents a picture of the strange infatuation of the human
understanding, but not of the depravity of the human will, without
an equal. There were thousands of pious Papists privy to and
ready to applaud the deed when done:—there was no one but
our old fifth-of-November friend, who still flutters in rags and straw
on the occasion, that had the courage to attempt it. In him stern
duty and unshaken faith prevailed over natural frailty. A man to
undertake and contemplate with gloomy delight this desperate task,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>could not certainly in the first instance, be a man of tender sensibility,
or over-liable to ‘the compunctious visitings of nature’; but he
would so far only be on a level with many others, and he would
be distinguished from them by a high principle of enthusiasm,
and a disinterested zeal for truth. Greater love than this has no
one, that he shall give up his life for the truth. We have no Guy
Fauxes now:—not that we have not numbers in whom ‘the spirit
is willing, but the flesh is weak.’ We talk indeed of flinging the
keys of the House of Commons into the Thames, by way of a little
unmeaning splutter, and a little courting of popularity and persecution;
but to fling ourselves into the gap, and blow up the system and our
own bodies to atoms at once, upon an abstract principle of right, does
not suit the <em>radical</em> scepticism of the age!</p>

<p class='c007'>I like the spirit of martyrdom, I confess: I envy an age that had
virtue enough in it to produce the mischievous fanaticism of a Guy
Faux. A man’s marching up to a masked-battery for the sake of
company, is nothing: but a man’s going resolutely to the stake rather
than surrender his opinion, is a serious matter. It shews that in the
public mind and feeling there is something better than life; that there
is a belief of something in the universe and the order of nature, to
which it is worth while to sacrifice this poor brief span of existence.
To have an object always in view dearer to one than one’s-self,
to cling to a principle in contempt of danger, of interest, of
the opinion of the world,—this is the true <em>ideal</em>, the high and heroic
state of man. It is in fact to have a standard of absolute and
implicit faith in the mind, that admits neither of compromise, degree,
nor exception. The path of duty is one, the grounds of encouragement
are fixed and invariable. Perhaps it is hardly possible to have
such a standard, but where the certain prospect of another world
absolves us from a miserly compact with this, and the contemplation
of infinity forms an habitual counterpoise to the illusions of time and
sense. An object of the highest conceivable greatness leads to
unmingled devotion: the belief in eternal truth embodies itself on
practical principles of strict rectitude, or of obstinate, but noble-minded
error.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was an instance that happened a little before the time of
Guy Faux, which, in a different way, has something of the same
character, with a more pleasing conclusion. I mean the story of
Margaret Lambrun; and as it is but little known, I shall here relate
it as I find it:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Margaret Lambrun was a Scotchwoman, and one of the retinue
of Mary Queen of Scots; as was also her husband, who dying of
grief for the tragical end of that princess, his wife took up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>resolution of revenging the death of both upon Queen Elizabeth.
For that purpose she put on a man’s habit; and assuming the name
of Anthony Sparke, repaired to the Court of the Queen of England,
always carrying with her a brace of pistols, one to kill Elizabeth, and
the other to shoot herself, in order to avoid the hands of justice; but
her design happened to miscarry by an accident, which saved the
Queen’s life. One day, as she was pushing through the crowd to
come up to her Majesty, who was then walking in her garden, she
chanced to drop one of the pistols. This being seen by the guards,
she was seized in order to be sent immediately to prison; but the
Queen, not suspecting her to be one of her own sex, had a mind
first to examine her. Accordingly, demanding her name, country,
and quality, Margaret replied with an unmoved steadiness,—“Madam,
though I appear in this habit, I am a woman; my name
is Margaret Lambrun; I was several years in the service of Queen
Mary, my mistress, whom you have so unjustly put to death; and
by her death you have also caused that of my husband, who died
of grief to see so innocent a queen perish so iniquitously. Now,
as I had the greatest love and affection for both these persons,
I resolved at the peril of my life to revenge their death by killing
you, who are the cause of both.”—The Queen pardoned her, and
granted her a safe conduct till she should be set upon the coast of
France.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Fanaticism expires with philosophy, and heroism with refinement.
There can be no mixture of scepticism in the one, nor any distraction
of interest in the other. That blind attachment to individuals or to
principles, which is necessary to make us stake our all upon a single
die, wears out with the progress of society. Sandt—(the last of that
school)—was a religious fanatic—a reader of the book of Maccabees,
a repeater of the story of Jael and Sisera, a chaunter of the song of
Deborah. What lighted up the dungeon-gloom in which Guy Faux
buried himself alive? The face of Heaven open to receive him.
What cheered his undivided solitude? The full assembly of Just
Men made perfect, the Glorious Company of Apostles, the Noble
Army of Martyrs, the expecting Conclave of Sainted Popes, of
Canonized Priests and Cardinals. What nerved his steady hand,
and prepared it, with temperate, even pulse, to apply the fatal
spark? The Hand of the Most High stretched out to meet him
and to welcome him into the abodes of the blest—‘Well done,
thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord!’ In his face we see an anticipated triumph that ‘no dim
doubts alloy’; he hears with no mortal ears the recording angels
‘quiring to the young-eyed cherubim’; a light flashes round him, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>beatific vision, from the wings of the Shining Ones: he sits, wreathed
and radiant, in the real presence! What need he fear what men can
do unto him? To a hope like his, swallowed up in fruition, the
shock that is soon to shatter his mortal frame plays harmless as the
summer-lightning: the flames that threaten to envelope him are the
wedding-garment of the Spouse. ‘This night thou shalt sup with
me in Paradise’—rings in his sleepless ears. On this rock he
builds his faith, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it!—Guy
Faux (poor wretch!) was as sure within himself of the
reward of his crime in the eternal salvation of his soul, as of his
intention to commit it: he no more doubted of another world than
he doubted of his own existence. A question whether his whole
creed might not be a delusion had never once crossed his mind.
How should it? He had never once heard it called in question.
He believed in it as he believed in all he had ever seen or heard, or
thought or felt, or been told by others—he believed in a future state
as he believed in this, with his senses and his understanding, and with
all his heart. Poor Guy—that miserable fifth-of-November scare-crow,
that stuffed straw figure, flaunting its own periodical disgrace—never
once dreamt (oh! glorious inheritance!) that he should die
like a dog. Otherwise, James and his parliament would have been
in no jeopardy from him. He was not a person of that refinement.
He thought for certain that he would go to Heaven or Hell; and he
played a bold, but (as he fancied) a sure game, for the former.
With such objects at stake, and with his own blinded reason, and a
stifled conscience, and implicit faith, and vowed obedience, and holy
Mother Church on his side, and a fixed hatred of heresy and of all
that belonged to it, as of a strange birth in nature, that made his flesh
creep and his brain reel, and a disregard of his own person, as ‘dross
compared to the glory hereafter to be revealed,’ he acted up to his
belief: the man was what he preached to others to be—no better, no
worse. Without this belief supporting him, what would he have
been? Like the wretched straw figure, the automaton we see
representing him, ‘disembowelled of his natural entrails, without a
real heart of flesh and blood beating in his bosom,’ a modern
time-server, an unimpassioned slave, a canting Jesuit, a petty,
cautious, meddling priest, a safe, underhand persecutor, an anonymous
slanderer, a cringing sycophant, promoting his own interest by taking
the bread out of honest mouths, a mercenary malignant coward, a
Clerical Magistrate, a Quarterly Reviewer, a Member of the
Constitutional Association, the concealed Editor of <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite>!</p>

<p class='c007'>The diffusion of knowledge, of inquiry, of doubt (or what Lord
Bacon calls ‘the infinite agitation of wit’) puts an end to ‘the soul
of goodness’ that there is in bigotry and superstition, and should to
its evil spirit at the same time. There is nothing so intolerable as
the union (which we see so common in modern times) of religious
hypocrisy with literary scepticism. The real bigot is a respectable
as well as enviable character. Not so the affected one. Downright,
rooted, rancorous prejudices are honest, hearty, wholesome things.
They keep the mind <em>in breath</em>. Not so the whining, hollow, designing
cant, which echoes without feeling them. The barbarous cruelties of
savage tribes are partly atoned for by the keen appetite for revenge in
which they originate: but we do not extend the same excuse to those
who poison for hire. The fires of Smithfield were kindled by a zeal
that burnt as bright and fierce as they. Our contemporaries who are
in the habit of throwing firebrands and death, do it without malice;
and laugh at those who do not understand the jest. The multiplication
of sects dissipates and tames down the rage of martyrdom. The
first grand defection indeed from an established and universal faith,
creates a shock and is assailed with a violence proportioned to the
firmness with which the parent-belief has been rooted in the public
mind: but the subsequent ramification of different schisms and modes
of faith from the first enormous heresy, tires out and neutralises the
spirit of both persecution and fanaticism. Religious controversy is a
war of words, and no longer a war of extermination. There may be
the same heart-burnings, the same jealousies of difference of opinion;
but they do not lead to the same fatal catastrophes or the same
heroic sacrifices. We cannot burn or hang one another for differing
from the Catholic faith as a crime of the most dreadful import, when
hardly any two men can be found to agree in the interpretation of the
same text. All opinions, by constant collision and attrition, become,
if not equally probable, equally familiar. Men’s minds are slowly
weaned from blind idolatrous bigotry and intolerant zeal, by the continually
increasing number of points of controversy and the frequency
of dispute. Then comes the general question as to the grounds and
reasonableness of the doctrines of religion itself; and a sceptical,
dispassionate, Epicurean work, like <cite>Bayle’s Dictionary</cite> or <cite>Hume’s
Essays</cite>, gives the finishing blow to what little remains of dogmatical
faith in established systems. After that, a zealot is another name for
an imposter. The reasons for belief may be as good or stronger
than ever; but the belief itself, as it is more rational, is less gross and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>headstrong. The closest deductions of the understanding do not act
like an instinct, or warrant a mortal antipathy; and let the philosophical
believer’s convictions be what they will, he cannot affect an
ignorance that it is possible for others to differ with him. A violent
and overstrained affectation of Orthodoxy is, after a certain time, a
sure sign of insincerity: the only zeal that can claim to be ‘according
to knowledge,’ is refined, calm, and considerate. I do not speak of
this sort of mitigated, sceptical, liberalised, enlightened belief, as
‘a consummation devoutly to be wished:’ (in my own particular,
I would rather have held opinion with Guy Faux, and have gone or
sent others to the Devil for that opinion)—I speak of the common
course of human affairs. I remember once observing to Wilkie, the
celebrated artist, that Dr. Chalmers (his old friend and schoolfellow)
had started an objection to the Christian religion, in order to have
the credit of answering it. The Scottish Teniers said, that if the
answer was a good one, he thought him right in bringing forward the
objection. I did not think this remark savoured of the acuteness one
would expect from such a man as Wilkie, and only said, I apprehended
those opinions were the strongest which had been never called
in question. <em>Reasoning is not believing</em>—whatever <em>seeing</em> may be,
according to the proverb.</p>

<p class='c007'>A devoted and incorrigible attachment to individuals, as well as to
doctrines, is weakened by the progress of knowledge and civilization.
A spirit of scepticism, of inquiry, of comparison, is introduced there
too, by the course of reading, observation, and reflection, which
strikes at the root of our disproportionate idolatry. Margaret
Lambrun did not think there was such another woman in the world
as her mistress, Queen Mary; nor could she, after her death, see
any thing in it worth living for. Had she had access to a modern
circulating library, she would have read of a hundred such heroines,
all peerless alike; and would have consoled herself for the death of
them all, one after another, pretty much in the same manner.
Margaret was not one of those who argue, according to Mr. Burke’s
improved political catechism, that ‘a king is but a king; a queen is
but a woman; a woman is but an animal; and that not an animal of
the highest order.’ She had more respect of persons than this.
The truth is, she had never seen such another woman as her mistress,
and she had no means, by books or otherwise, of forming an idea of
any thing but what she saw. In that isolated state of society, people
grew together like trees, and clung round the strongest for support,
‘as the vine curls its tendrils.’ They became devoted to others with
the same violence of attachment as they were to themselves. Novels,
plays, magazines, treatises of philosophy, Monthly Museums, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span><i><span lang="fr">Belles Assemblées</span></i>, did not fly in numbers about the country and
‘through the airy region stream so bright,’ as to blot out the impression
of all real forms. The effects of habit, of sense, of service, of
affection, did not find an ideal level in general literature and artificial
models. The heart made its election once, and was fixed till
death: the eyes doated on fancied perfection, and were divorced
from every other object afterwards. There was not the same communication
of ideas; there was not the same change of place or
acquaintance. The prejudices of rank, of custom, strengthened the
bias of individual admiration; and it is no wonder, where all these
circumstances were combined, that the presence of a person, whom
we had loved and served, became a feeling, an appetite, and a passion
in the mind, almost necessary to existence. The taking our idol
away (and by cruel and treacherous means) would be taking away
the prop that sustained life, and on which all the pride of the
affections leant. Its loss would be the loss of another self; and a
double loss of this kind (as in the instance alluded to) could seek for
no solace but in the death of her who had caused it. Where the
mind had become rivetted to a certain object, where it had embarked
its all in the sacred cause of friendship and inviolable fidelity, it would
be in vain to offer the consolations of philosophy when the heart
owned none. Other scenes, new friends, fresh engagements, might
be proper for others; but Margaret Lambrun’s wounded spirit could
find no relief but in looking forward to a full revenge for a murdered
mistress and husband. You might as well think of wedding the soul
to another body, as of inspiring her with other hopes and thoughts
than those which she had lost for ever:—she could not live without
those whom she had loved so well and long, and she was ready to die
for them. Life becomes indifferent to a mind haunted by a passion
of this sort. Death is not then a choice, but rather a necessity.
We cannot live, and have the desire nearest to our souls. To play
the hero, it is only necessary to be wound up to such an unavoidable
interest in any thing, as reflection, prudence, natural instinct, have no
power over. To be a hero, is, in other words, to lose the sense of
our personal identity in some object dearer to us than ourselves. He
may purchase any thing he pleases, who is ready to part with his life
for it. Wherever there is a passion or belief strong enough to blind
us to consequences, there the mind is capable of any sacrifice and of
any undertaking.</p>

<p class='c007'>The heroical is the fanaticism of common life: it is the contempt
of danger, of pain, of death, in the pursuit of a favourite idea. The
rule of honour, as of conscience, is to contemplate things in the
abstract, and never as affecting or reacting upon yourself; the hero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>is an instrument in the hands of fate, as is himself impassive to its
blows. A man in a passion, or who is worked up to a certain pitch
of enthusiasm, minds nothing else. The fear of death, the love of
self, is but an idea or motive with a certain habitual strength. Raise
any other idea or feeling to a greater habitual or momentary height,
and it will supplant or overrule the first. Courage is sometimes the
effect of despair. Women, in a fit of romance, or on some sudden
emergency, have been known to perform feats of heroic daring, from
which men of the stoutest nerves might shrink with dismay.
Maternal tenderness is heroic. Affection of any kind, that doats
upon a particular object, and absorbs every other consideration in that,
is in its nature heroic.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Passion is the great ingredient in heroism.
He who stops to reflect, to balance one thing against another, is a
coward. The better part of valour is indiscretion. All passion is a
short-lived madness, or state of intoxication, in which some present
impulse or prevailing idea gets uncontrouled possession of the mind,
and lords it there at will. A man may be (almost literally) drunk
with choler, with love, with jealousy, with revenge, as he may with
wine or strong drink. Any of these will overpower his reason and
senses, and put him beyond himself. The master-feeling will prevail,
whatever it is, and when it once gets the upper hand, will rage the
more violently in proportion to the obstacles it has to encounter.
Women who associate with robbers are cruel, as soon as they get
over their first repugnance: some of the bravest officers have been
the greatest Martinets. A man who is afraid of a blow, or tender of
his person, will yet, on being struck, feel nothing but the mortification
of the affront, and the fear of discomfiture. The pain that is inflicted,
after his blood is once up, will only aggravate his resentment, and be
diverted from the channels of fear into those of rage and shame. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>whose will is roused and holds out in this way, whose tenaciousness
of purpose and inflammability of spirit are proof against the extremity
of pain, of fatigue, and disaster, is said to have <em>pluck</em>. So a man may
not be able to reason himself into coolness at the commencement of
a battle; but a ball whizzing near him does it, by abstracting his
imagination from a thousand idle fears, and fixing it on his
immediate situation and duty. The novice in an engagement, that
before was motionless with apprehension or trembling like a leaf,
after being hit, loses the sense of possible contingencies in the grief
of his wound, and fights like a devil incarnate. He is thenceforward
too busy to think of himself. He rushes fearlessly on danger and on
death. A man in a battle is indeed emphatically <em>beside himself</em>. He
‘bears a charmed life,’ that in fancy disarms cannon-balls and bullets
of their power to hurt. They are mere names and apparitions from
which astonishment and necessity have taken out the sting: the sense
of feeling is seared and dead for the time to ‘all mortal consequences.’
The mind is sublimated to a disregard of whatever can happen, and
tempted to rush without provocation on its fate, purely out of bravado,
and as the triumph of its paramount feeling, an exasperation of its
temporary insanity. Courage is in many such cases only a violent
effort to shake off fear, a determination of the imagination to seize
on any object that may divert its present dread. A soldier is a
perfect hero but that he is a mere machine. He is drilled into
disinterestedness, and beaten into courage. He is a very patriotic
and romantic automaton. He has lost all regard for himself and
concern for others. His life, his limbs, his soul and body, are
obedient only to the word of command. ‘Set duty in one eye and
death in the other, and he can look on death indifferently.’</p>

same way, but he does it of his own accord, and from an inward
sentiment. The service on which he is bound is perfect freedom.
He is not a machine, but a free agent. He knows his cue without a

<p class='c007'>Thus a knight-errant going on adventures, and following out the fine
idea of love and gallantry in his own mind, without once thinking of
himself but as a vessel dedicated to virtue and honour, is one of the most
enviable fictions in the whole world. Don Quixote, in the midst of
its comic irony, is the finest serious developement to be found of this
character. The account of the Cid, the famous Spanish hero, of
which Mr. Southey has given an admirable prose-translation where
scarcely a word could be changed or transposed without injuring the
force and clear simplicity of the antique style he has adopted, abounds
with instances to the same purpose. His taking back the lion to its
den, his bringing his father ‘the herb that would cure him,’ his
enemy’s head, and his manner of reclaiming a recreant knight from
his cowardice by heaping the rewards and distinctions of courage upon
him, are some of those that I remember as the most striking. Perhaps
the reader may not have the book by him; yet they are worth turning
to, both for the sentiment and the expression. The first then in order
is the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘At this time it came to pass that there was strife between Count
Don Gomez the Lord of Gormaz, and Diego Laynez the father of
Rodrigo (the Cid); and the Count insulted Diego and gave him a
blow. Now Diego was a man in years, and his strength had passed
from him, so that he could not take vengeance, and he retired to his
home to dwell there in solitude and lament over his dishonour. And
he took no pleasure in his food, neither could he sleep by night, nor
would he lift up his eyes from the ground, nor stir out of his house,
nor commune with his friends, but turned from them in silence as if
the breath of his shame would taint them. Rodrigo was yet but a
youth, and the Count was a mighty man in arms, one who gave his
voice first in the Cortez, and was held to be the best in the war, and
so powerful, that he had a thousand friends among the mountains.
Howbeit, all these things appeared as nothing to Rodrigo, when he
thought of the wrong done to his father, the first which had ever been
offered to the blood of Layn Calvo. He asked nothing but justice of
Heaven, and of man he asked only a fair field; and his father seeing
of how good heart he was, gave him his sword and his blessing. The
sword had been the Sword of Mudarra in former times, and when
Rodrigo held its cross in its hand, he thought within himself that his
arm was not weaker than Mudarra’s. And he went out and defied the
Count and slew him, and smote off his head, and carried it home to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>father. The old man was sitting at table, the food lying before him
untasted, when Rodrigo returned, and pointing to the head which hung
from the horse’s collar, dropping blood, he bade him look up, for
there was the herb which would restore to him his appetite; the
tongue, quoth he, which insulted<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c009'><sup>[37]</sup></a> you, is no longer a tongue, and the
hand which wronged you is no longer a hand. And the old man
arose and embraced his son and placed him above him at the table;
saying that he who brought home that head should be the head of the
house of Layn Calvo.’—<cite>Chronicle of the Cid</cite>, <em>p. 4</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next is of Martin Pelaez, whom the Cid made of a notable
coward a redoubtable hero:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Here the history relates, that at this time Martin Pelaez the
Asturian came with a convoy of laden beasts, carrying provision to the
hosts of the Cid; and as he passed near the town, the Moors sallied
out in great numbers against him; but he, though he had few with him,
defended the convoy right well, and did great hurt to the Moors,
slaying many of them, and drove them into the town. This Martin
Pelaez, who is here spoken of, did the Cid make a right good knight
of a coward, as ye shall hear. When the Cid first began to lay siege to
the City of Valencia, this Martin Pelaez came unto him: he was a
knight, a native of Santillance in Asturias, a hidalgo, great of body and
strong of limb, a well-made man and of goodly semblance, but withal a
right coward at heart, which he had shown in many places where he
was among feats of arms. And the Cid was sorry when he came
unto him, though he would not let him perceive this; for he knew he
was not fit to be of his company. Howbeit, he thought that since he
was come, he would make him brave whether he would or not. And
when the Cid began to war upon the town, and sent parties against it
twice and thrice a day, as ye have heard, for the Cid was always upon
the alert, there was fighting and tourneying every day. One day it
fell out that the Cid and his kinsmen and friends and vassals were
engaged in a great encounter, and this Martin Pelaez was well armed;
and when he saw that the Moors and Christians were at it, he fled
and betook himself to his lodging, and there hid himself till the Cid
returned to dinner. And the Cid saw what Martin Pelaez did, and
when he had conquered the Moors, he returned to his lodging to dinner.
Now it was the custom of the Cid to eat at a high table, seated on
his bench at the head. And Don Alvar Fannez and Pero Bermudez
and other precious knights ate in another part, at high tables full
honourably, and none other knights whatsoever dared to take their
seats with them, unless they were such as deserved to be there; and
the others who were not so approved in arms ate upon <i><span lang="es">estradas</span></i>, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>tables with cushions. This was the order in the house of the Cid,
and every one knew the place where he was to sit at meat, and every
one strove all he could to gain the honour of sitting to eat at the table
of Don Alvar Fannez and his companions, by strenuously behaving
himself in all feats of arms; and thus the honour of the Cid was
advanced. This Martin Pelaez, thinking that none had seen his badness,
washed his hands in turn with the other knights, and would
have taken his place among them. And the Cid went unto him and
took him by the hand and said, You are not such a one as deserves to
sit with these, for they are worth more than you or than me, but I
will have you with me; and he seated him with himself at table.
And he, for lack of understanding, thought that the Cid did this to
honour him above all the others. On the morrow the Cid and his
company rode towards Valencia, and the Moors came out to the
tourney; and Martin Pelaez went out well armed, and was among the
foremost who charged the Moors, and when he was in among them he
turned the reins, and went back to his lodging; and the Cid took
heed to all that he did, and saw that though he had done badly, he
had done better than the first day. And when the Cid had driven
the Moors into the town, he returned to his lodging, and as he sate
down to meat, he took this Martin Pelaez by the hand, and seated him
with himself, and bade him eat with him in the same dish, for he had
deserved more that day than he had the first. And the knight gave
heed to that saying, and was abashed; howbeit, he did as the Cid
commanded him: and after he had dined, he went to his lodging and
began to think upon what the Cid had said unto him, and perceived that
he had seen all the baseness which he had done; and then he understood
that for this cause he would not let him sit at board with the
other knights who were precious in arms, but had seated him with
himself, more to affront him than to do him honour, for there were
other knights there better than he, and he did not show them that
honour. Then resolved he in his heart to do better than he had done
hitherto. Another day the Cid and his company and Martin Pelaez
rode towards Valencia, and the Moors came out to the tourney full
resolutely, and Martin Pelaez was among the first, and charged them
right boldly; and he smote down and slew presently a good knight,
and he lost there all the bad fear which he had had, and was that day
one of the best knights there: and as long as the tourney lasted, there
he remained fighting and slaying and overthrowing the Moors, till
they were driven within the gates, in such manner that the Moors
marvelled at him, and asked where that Devil came from, for they had
never seen him before. And the Cid was in a place where he could
see all that was going on, and he gave good heed to him, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>great pleasure in beholding him, to see how well he had forgotten the
great fear which he was wont to have. And when the Moors were
shut up within the town, the Cid and all his people returned to their
lodging, and Martin Pelaez full leisurely and quietly went to his
lodging also, like a good knight. And when it was the hour of eating,
the Cid waited for Martin Pelaez, and when he came and they
had washed, the Cid took him by the hand, and said, My friend, you
are not such a one as deserves to sit with me henceforth, but sit you
here with Don Alvar Fannez, and with these other good knights, for
the good feats which you have done this day have made you a companion
for them; and from the day forward he was placed in the
company of the good.’—p. 199.</p>

<hr class='c021'>

<p class='c007'>‘There was a lion in the house of the Cid, who had grown a large
one, and strong, and was full nimble; three men had the keeping of
this lion, and they kept him in a den which was in a courtyard, high
up in the palace; and when they cleansed the court, they were wont
to shut him up in his den, and afterwards to open the door that he
might come out and eat: the Cid kept him for his pastime, that he
might take pleasure with him when he was minded so to do. Now it
was the custom of the Cid to dine every day with his company, and
after he had dined, he was wont to sleep awhile upon his seat. And
one day when he had dined, there came a man and told him that a
great fleet was arrived in the port of Valencia, wherein there was a
great power of the Moors, whom King Bucar had brought over, the
sons of the Miramamolin of Morocco. And when the Cid heard
this, his heart rejoiced and he was glad, for it was nigh three years
since he had had a battle with the Moors. Incontinently he ordered
a signal to be made, that all the honourable men who were in the city
should assemble together. And when they were all assembled in the
Alcazar, and his sons-in-law with them, the Cid told them the news,
and took counsel with them in what manner they should go out against
this great power of the Moors. And when they had taken counsel,
the Cid went to sleep upon his seat, and the Infantes and the others
sate playing at tables and chess. Now at this time the men who were
keepers of the lion were cleaning out the court, and when they heard
the cry that the Moors were coming, they opened the den, and came
down into the palace where the Cid was, and left the door of the
court open. And when the lion had ate his meat, and saw that the
door was open, he went out of the court and came down into the
palace even into the hall where they all were: and when they who
were there saw him, there was a great stir among them: but the Infantes
of Carrion showed greater cowardice than all the rest. Ferrando
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Gonzalez having no shame, neither for the Cid nor for the others who
were present, crept under the seat whereon the Cid was sleeping, and
in his haste he burst his mantle and his doublet also at the shoulders.
And Diego Gonzalez, the other, ran to a postern door, crying, I
shall never see Carrion again! This door opened upon a courtyard,
where there was a wine-press, and he jumped out, and by reason of the
great height could not keep his feet, but fell among the lees and
defiled himself therewith. And all the others who were in the hall
wrapt their cloaks around their arms, and stood round about the seat
whereon the Cid was sleeping, that they might defend him. The
noise which they made awakened the Cid, and he saw the lion coming
towards him, and he lifted up his hand and said, What is this!...
and the lion hearing his voice stood still: and he rose up and took him
by the mane, as if he had been a gentle mastiff, and led him back to
the court where he was before, and ordered his keepers to look better
to him for the time to come. And when he had done this, he
returned to the hall and took his seat again; and all they who beheld
it were greatly astonished.’—p. 251.</p>

<p class='c007'>The presence of mind, the manly confidence, the faith in virtue, the
lofty bearing and picturesque circumstances in all these stories, are as
fine as any thing can well be imagined.—The last of them puts me in
mind, that that heroic little gentleman, Mr. Kean, who is a Cid too in
his way, keeps a lion ‘for his pastime, that he may take pleasure with
him when he is minded so to do.’ It is, to be sure, an American
lion, a puma, a sort of a great dog. But still it shews the nature of
the man, and the spirited turn of his genius. Courage is the great
secret of his success. His acting is, if not classical, heroical. To
dare and to do are with him the same thing. ‘Masterless passion
sways him to the mood of what it likes or loaths.’ He may be sometimes
wrong, but he is decidedly wrong, and does not betray himself
by paltry doubts and fears. He takes the lion by the mane. He
gains all by hazarding all. He throws himself into the breach, and
fights his way through as well as he can. He leaves all to his feelings,
and goes where they lead him; and he finds his account in this
method, and brings rich ventures home.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reading the foregoing accounts of the Spanish author, it seems
that in those times killing was no murder. Slaughter was the order
of the day. The blood of Moors and Christians flows through the
page as so much water. The proverb uppermost in their minds was,
that a man could die but once, and the inference seemed to be, the
sooner the better. In these more secure and civilized times (individually
and as far as it depends upon ourselves) we are more chary of
our lives. We are (ordinarily) placed out of the reach of ‘the shot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>of accident and dart of chance’; and grow indolent, tender, and
effeminate in our notions and habits. Books do not make men
valiant,—not even the reading the chronicle of the Cid. The police
look after all breaches of the peace and resorts of suspicious characters,
so that we need not buckle on our armour to go to the succour of distressed
damsels, or to give battle to giants and enchanters. Instead of
killing some fourteen before breakfast, like <em>Hotspur</em>, we are contented
to read of these things in the newspapers, or to see them performed
on the stage. We enjoy all the dramatic interest of such scenes,
without the tragic results. Regnault de St. Jean Angely rode like a
madman through the streets of Paris, when from the barricades he
saw the Prussians advancing. We love, fight, and are slain by proxy—live
over the adventures of a hundred heroes and die their deaths—and
the next day are as well as ever, and ready to begin again. This
is a gaining concern, and an improvement on the old-fashioned way of
risking life and limb in good earnest, as a cure for <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. It is a bad
speculation to come to an untimely end by way of killing time. Now,
like the heroic personages in <cite>Tom Thumb</cite>, we spread a white pocket-handkerchief
to prepare our final catastrophe, and act the <em>sentiment</em> of
death with all the impunity to be desired. Men, the more they cultivate
their intellect, become more careful of their persons. They would
like to think, to read, to dream on for ever, without being liable to
any worldly annoyance. ‘Be mine to read eternal new romances, of
Marivaux and Crebillon,’ cries the insatiable adept in this school.
Art is long, and they think it hard that life should be so short.
Their existence has been chiefly theatrical, ideal, a tragedy rehearsed
in print—why should it receive its <em>denouement</em> in their proper persons,
in <i><span lang="la">corpore vili</span></i>?—In another point of view, sedentary, studious
people live in a world of thought—in a world out of themselves—and
are not very well prepared to scuffle in this. They lose the sense of
personal honour on questions of more general interest, and are not
inclined to individual sacrifices that can be of no service to the cause
of letters. They do not see how any speculative truth can be proved
by their being run through the body; nor does your giving them the
lie alter the state of any one of the great leading questions in policy,
morals, or criticism. Philosophers might claim the privileges of
divines for many good reasons; among these, according to Spenser,
exemption from worldly care and peril was not the least in monkish
lore:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘From worldly care himself he did esloine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And greatly shunned manly exercise:</div>
      <div class='line'>For every work he challenged essoine,</div>
      <div class='line'>For contemplation-sake.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Mental courage is the only courage I pretend to. I dare venture an
opinion where few else would, particularly if I think it right. I have
retracted few of my positions. Whether this arises from obstinacy or
strength, or indifference to the opinions of others, I know not. In
little else I have the spirit of martyrdom: but I would give up any
thing sooner than an abstract proposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Canning was the cleverest boy at Eton: he is, perhaps, the
cleverest man in the House of Commons. It is, however, in the
sense in which, according to Mr. Wordsworth, ‘the child is father
to the man.’ He has grown up entirely out of what he then was.
He has merely ingrafted a set of Parliamentary phrases and the
technicalities of debate on the themes and school-exercises he was set
to compose when a boy. Nor has he ever escaped from the trammels
imposed on youthful genius: he has never assumed a manly independence
of mind. He has been all his life in the habit of getting up a
speech at the nod of a Minister, as he used to get up a thesis under
the direction of his school-master. The <em>matter</em> is nothing; the only
question is, how he shall express himself. The consequence has been
as might be expected. Not being at liberty to chuse his own side of
the question, nor to look abroad into the world for original (but
perhaps unwelcome) observations, nor to follow up a strict chain of
reasoning into its unavoidable consequences, the whole force of his
mind has been exhausted in an attention to the ornaments of style and
to an agreeable and imposing selection of topics. It is his business
and his inclination to embellish what is trite, to gloss over what is
true, to vamp up some feeble sophism, to spread the colours of a
meretricious fancy over the unexpected exposure of some dark
intrigue, some glaring iniquity—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like as the sun-burnt Indians do array</div>
      <div class='line'>Their tawny bodies in their proudest plight</div>
      <div class='line'>With painted plumes in goodly order dight:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As those same plumes, so seemed he vain and light,</div>
      <div class='line'>That by his gait might easily appear;</div>
      <div class='line'>For still he fared as dancing in delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in his hands a windy fan did bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in the idle air he moved still here and there.’</div>
      <div class='line in50'><span class='sc'>Spenser.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>His reasoning is a tissue of glittering sophistry; his language is a
<i><span lang="la">cento</span></i> of florid common-places. The smooth monotony of his style is
indeed as much borrowed, is as little his own, as the courtly and often
fulsome strain of his sentiments. He has no steady principles, no
strong passions, nothing original, masculine, or striking in thought or
expression. There is a feeble, diffuse, showy, Asiatic redundancy in
all his speeches—something vapid, something second-hand in the
whole cast of his mind. The light that proceeds from it gleams from
the mouldering materials of corruption: the flowers that are seen
there, gay and flaunting, bloom over the grave of humanity!—Mr.
Canning never, by any chance, reminds one of the poet or the philosopher,
of the admirer of nature, or even the man of the world—he
is a mere House-of-Commons man, or, since he was transferred there
from College, appears never to have seen or thought of any other
place. He may be said to have passed his life in making and learning
to make speeches. All other objects and pursuits seem to have been
quite lost upon him. He has overlooked the ordinary objects of
nature, the familiar interests of human life, as beneath his notice.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c009'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
There is no allusion in any of his speeches to anything passing out of
the House, or not to be found in the classics. Their tone is quite
Parliamentary—his is the Delphin edition of Nature. Not an image
has struck his eye, not an incident has touched his heart, any farther
than it could be got up for rhetorical and stage effect. This has an
ill effect upon his speeches:—it gives them that shining and bloated
appearance which is the result of the confined and heated atmosphere
of the House. They have the look of exotics, of artificial, hot-house
plants. Their glossiness, their luxuriance, and gorgeousness of colour
are greater than their strength or <em>stamina</em>: they are forced, not lasting,
nor will they bear transplanting from the rank and noxious soil in
which they grow. Or rather, perhaps, they bear the same relation
to eloquence that artificial flowers do to real ones—alike, yet not the
same, without vital heat or the power of reproduction, printed,
passionless, specious mockeries. They are, in fact, not the growth of
truth, of nature, and feeling, but of state policy, of art, and practice.
To deny that Mr. Canning has arrived to a great perfection (perhaps
the greatest) in the manufacture of these sort of <em>common-places</em>, elegant,
but somewhat tarnished, imposing, but not solid, would, we think,
show a want of candour: to affirm that he has ever done anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>more (in his serious attempts) would, we think, show an equal want
of taste and understanding.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c009'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The way in which Mr. Canning gets up the staple-commodity of
his speeches appears to be this. He hears an observation on the
excellence of the English Constitution, or on the dangers of Reform
and the fickleness and headstrong humours of the people, dropped by
some Member of the House, or he meets with it in an old Debate in
the time of Sir Robert Walpole, or in Paley’s Moral and Political
Philosophy, which our accomplished scholar read, of course, as the
established text-book at the University. He turns it in his mind: by
dint of memory and ingenuity he illustrates it by the application of
some well-known and well-authenticated simile at hand, such as ‘the
vessel of the state,’ ‘the torrent of popular fury,’ ‘the precipice of
reform,’ ‘the thunderbolt of war,’ ‘the smile of peace,’ &#38;c. He
improves the hint by the help of a little play upon words and upon
an idle fancy into an allegory, he hooks this on to a verbal inference,
which takes you by surprise, equally from the novelty of the premises
and the flatness of the conclusion, refers to a passage in Cicero in
support of his argument, quotes his authority, relieves exhausted
attention by a sounding passage from Virgil, ‘like the morn risen on
mid-noon,’ and launches the whole freight of wisdom, wit, learning,
and fancy, on the floor of St. Stephen’s Chapel, where it floats and
glitters amidst the mingled curiosity and admiration of both sides of
the House—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>‘Scylla heard,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fell Charybdis murmur’d soft applause.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Beneath the broad and gilded chandelier that throws its light upon
‘the nation’s Great Divan,’ Mr. Canning piles the lofty harangue,
high over-arched with metaphor, dazzling with epithets, sparkling
with jests—take it out of doors, or examine it by the light of common
sense, and it is no more than a paltry string of sophisms, of trite
truisms, and sorry buffooneries. There is also a House-of-Commons
jargon as well as a scholastic pedantry in this gentleman’s style of
oratory, which is very displeasing to all but professional ears. ‘The
Honourable and Learned Gentleman,’ and ‘his Honourable and
Gallant Friend,’ are trolled over the tongue of the Honourable
Speaker, ‘loud as a trumpet with a silver sound,’ and fill up the
pauses of the sense or the gaps in the logic with a degree of burlesque
self-complacency and pompous inanity. Mr. Canning speaks by rote;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>and if the words he utters become the mouth and round a period well,
he cares little how cheaply he comes by them, or how dear they cost
the country! Such mechanic helps to style and technical flourishes
and trappings of upstart self-importance are, however, unworthy of the
meanest underling of office.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is, notwithstanding, a facility, a brilliancy, and an elegance
in Mr. Canning’s general style, always graceful, never abrupt, never
meagre, never dry, copious without confusion, dignified without
stiffness, perspicuous yet remote from common life, that must excite
surprise in an <em>extempore</em> speaker. Mr. Canning, we apprehend, is <em>not</em>
an <em>extempore</em> speaker. He only makes set speeches on set occasions.
He indeed hooks them in as answers to some one that has gone before
him in the debate, by taking up and commenting on a single sentence
or so, but he immediately recurs to some old and favourite topic,
launches into the middle of the stream, or mounts upon the <em>high horse</em>,
and rides it to the end of the chapter. He never (that we are aware
of) grappled with a powerful antagonist, overthrew him on the spot,
or contested the point with him foot to foot. Mr. Canning’s replies
are <em>evasions</em>. He indeed made a capital and very deservedly admired
reply to Sir John Coxe Hippesley; but Sir John had given notice of
all his motions a month beforehand, and Mr. Canning had only to lie
in ambush for him with a whole magazine of facts, arguments, alliterations,
quotations, jests, and squibs, prepared ready to explode and
blow him up into the air in an instant. In this manner he contrives
to slip into the debate and speak to the question, as if he had lately
entered the House and heard the arguments on the other side stated
for the first time in his life. He has conned his speeches over for a
week or a month previously, but he gives these premeditated effusions
the effect of witty impromptus—the spontaneous ebullitions of the
laughter or indignation or lofty enthusiasm of the moment. His
manner tells this. It is that of a person trying to recollect a speech,
and reciting it from beginning to end with studied gesture, and in an
emphatic but monotonous and somewhat affected tone of voice, rather
than of a person uttering words and thoughts that have occurred to
him for the first time, and hurried away by an involuntary impulse,
speaking with more or less hesitation, faster or slower, and with more
or less passion, according as the occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Canning is a <em>conventional</em> speaker; he is an <em>optional</em> politician.
He has a ready and splendid assortment of arguments upon all ordinary
questions: he takes that side or view of a question that is dictated by
his vanity, his interest, or his habits, and endeavours to make the best
he can of it. Truth, liberty, justice, humanity, war or peace, civilization
or barbarism, are things of little consequence, except for him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>make speeches upon them. He thinks ‘the worse the better reason,’
if he can only make it appear so to others; and in the attempt to
confound and mislead, he is greatly assisted by really perceiving no
difference himself. It is not what a thing is, but what he can say
about it, that is ever uppermost in his mind; and why should he be
squeamish or have any particular choice, since his words are all
equally fine, and delivered with equal volubility of tongue! His
balanced periods are the scale ‘that makes these odds all even.’ Our
Orator does not confine himself to any one view of a subject. He
does not blind himself by any dull prejudice: he does not tie himself
down to any pedantic rules or abstract principle. He does not listen
implicitly to common sense, nor does he follow the independent
dictates of his own judgment. No, he picks and chuses among all
these, as best suits his purpose. He plucks out the grey hairs of
a question, and then again the black. He shifts his position; it is a
<em>ride-and-tie</em> system with him. He mounts sometimes behind prejudice,
and sometimes behind reason. He is now with the wise, and then
again with the vulgar. He drivels, or he raves. He is now wedded
to antiquity, anon there is no innovation too startling for him. At one
time he is literal, at another visionary and romantic. At one time
the honour of the country sways him, at another its interest. One
moment he is all for liberty, and the next for slavery. First we are
to hold the balance of Europe, and to dictate and domineer over the
whole world; and then we are to creep into our shells and draw in
our horns; one moment resembling Don Quixote, and the next
playing the part of Sancho Panza! And why not? All these are
topics, are <em>cues</em> used in the game of politics, are colours in the changeable
coat of party, are dilemmas in casuistry, are pretexts in diplomacy;
and Mr. Canning has them all at his fingers’ ends. What is there
then to prevent his using any of them as he pleases? Nothing in the
world but feeling or principle; and as Mr. Canning is not withheld
by these from running his heedless career, the application of his
ingenuity and eloquence in all such cases is perfectly arbitrary, ‘quite
<em>optional</em>,’ as Mr. Liston expresses it. A wise man would have some
settled opinion, a good man would wish well to some cause, a modest
man would be afraid to act without feeling sure of his ground, or to
show an utter disregard of right or wrong. Mr. Canning has the
luckless ambition to play off the tricks of a political rope-dancer, and
he chuses to do it on the nerves of humanity! He has called out
for war during thirty years without ceasing, ‘like importunate Guinea
fowls, one note day and night;’ he has made the House and the
country ring with his vain clamour, and now for the first time he is
silent, ‘quite chopfallen.’ Like <em>Bottom</em> in the play, ‘he aggravates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>his voice like a sucking-dove;’ ‘he roars you an ’twere any nightingale!’
After the failure of Buonaparte’s Russian expedition, Mr.
Canning exclaimed exultingly, and with a daring enthusiasm that
seemed to come from the heart, that ‘he rejoiced that barbarism had
been the first to resist invasion, since it showed that the love of
national independence was an instinctive principle in every country,
superior even to the love of liberty.’ This plea served its turn at the
time, and we heard no more of it last year when the French invaded
Spain. In the war to restore Ferdinand, Mr. Canning echoed with
lungs of brass the roar of ‘the universal Spanish nation,’ and the words
Liberty and Humanity hung like music on his tongue; but when the
feeble Monarch was restored, and trod upon the necks of those who
had restored him, and threw down the mock-scaffold of the Constitution
that had raised him once more to the throne, we heard no
more of ‘the universal Spanish nation,’ of Liberty and Humanity.
When the speeches of Mr. Canning and the Manifestos of his friends
had raised the power of France to a gigantic height that hung like a
precipice over our heads, we were to go on, and fight out the battle
of liberty and independence, though ‘we buried ourselves under the
ruins of the civilized world.’ When a monstrous claim that threatens
the liberty and existence of the civilized world is openly set up and
acted upon, and a word from Mr. Canning would arrest its progress
in the direction in which it is moving with obscene, ghastly, bloodstained
strides, he courteously and with great condescension reminds
his hearers of ‘the inimitable satire of Cervantes,’ that there is a
proverbial expression borrowed from it, and that the epithet <em>Quixotic</em>
would be eminently applicable to the conduct of Great Britain if she
interfered in the affairs of the continent at the present juncture. And
yet there are persons who persist in believing that Mr. Canning is
any thing more than a pivot on whose oily hinges state policy turns
easily at this moment, unheard, unseen, and that he has views and
feelings of his own that are a pledge for his integrity. If all this were
fickleness, caprice, forgetfulness, accident, folly, it would be well or
would not much signify; we should stand a chance of sometimes
being right, sometimes wrong; or if the ostensible motives were the
real ones, they would balance one another. At one time we should
be giving a <em>lift</em> to liberty, at another we should be advancing our own
interests: now we should be generous to others, then we should be
just to ourselves, but always we should be doing something or other
fit to be done and to be named, and acting up to one or other of Mr.
Canning’s fine pleas of religion, morality, or social order. Is that the
case? Nothing was said for twenty years about the restoration of
the Bourbons as the object of the war. Who doubts it now? This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>cause skulked behind the throne, and was not let out in any of Mr.
Canning’s speeches. The cloven foot was concealed by so much
flaunting oratory, by so many different facings and piebald patch-work
liveries of ruinous policy or perfidious principle, as not to be suspected.
This is what makes such persons as Mr. Canning dangerous. Clever
men are the tools with which bad men work. The march of sophistry
is devious: the march of power is one. Its means, its tools, its
pretexts are various, and borrowed like the hues of the camelion from
any object that happens to be at hand: its object is ever the same,
and deadly as the serpent’s fang. It moves on to its end with crested
majesty, erect, silent, with eyes sunk and fixed, undiverted by fear,
unabashed by shame, and puny orators and patriot mountebanks play
tricks before it to amuse the crowd, till it crushes the world in its
monstrous folds. There is one word about which nothing has been
said all this while in accounting for Mr. Canning’s versatility of
mind and vast resources in reasoning—it is the word, <em>Legitimacy</em>. It
is the key with which you ‘pluck out the heart of his mystery.’ It
is the touchstone by which all his other eloquence is to be tried, and
made good or found wanting. It is the casting-weight in the scale of
sound policy, or that makes humanity and liberty kick the beam. It
is the secret of the Ayes and Noes: it accounts for the Majorities
and Minorities. It weighs down all other considerations, hides all
flaws, makes up for all deficiencies, removes all obstacles, is the crown
of success, and makes defeat glorious. It has all the power of the
Crown on its side, and all the madness of the people. All Mr.
Canning’s speeches are but so many different <em>periphrases</em> for this one
word—<cite>Legitimacy</cite>. It is the foundation of his magnanimity and the
source of his pusillanimity. It is the watch-word equally of his
oratory or his silence. It is the principle of his interference and of
his forbearance. It makes him move forward, or retreat, or stand
still. With this word rounded closely in his ear, and with fifty
evasions for it in his mouth, he advances boldly to ‘the deliverance
of mankind’—into the hands of legitimate kings, but can do nothing
to deliver them out of their power. When the liberty and independence
of mankind can be construed to mean the cause of kings and the
doctrine of divine right, Mr. Canning is a virago on the side of
humanity—when they mean the cause of the people and the reducing
of arbitrary power within the limits of constitutional law, his patriotism
and humanity flag, and he is</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of his port as meek as is a maid!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This word makes his tropes and figures expand and blaze out like
phosphorus, or ‘freezes his spirits up like fish in a pond.’ It smites
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>with its petrific mace, it deadens with its torpedo touch, the Minister,
the Parliament, the people, and makes this vast, free, enlightened,
and enterprising country a body without a soul, an inert mass, like
the hulks of our men of war, which Mr. Canning saw and described
so well at Plymouth. It is the same word, that announcing the profanation
of ‘the golden round that binds the hollow temples of a king’
by unhallowed hands, would fill their sails, and hurl their thunders on
rebel shores. It denounces war, it whispers peace. It is echoed by
the groans of the nations, is sanctified by their blood, bought with
their treasure. It is this that fills the time-rent towers of the Inquisition
with tears and piercing cries; and owing to this, Manzotti shrieks
in Italian dungeons, while Mr. Canning soothes the House of
Commons with the soft accents of liberty and peace! In fine,
Mr. Canning’s success as an orator, and the space he occupies in the
public mind, are strong indications of the Genius of the Age, in
which words have obtained a mastery over things, ‘and to call evil
good and good evil,’ is thought the mark of a superior and happy
spirit. An accomplished statesman in our day is one who extols the
Constitution and violates it—who talks about religion and social
order, and means slavery and superstition. The Whigs are always
reminding the reigning family of <em>the principles that raised them to the
throne</em>—the Tories labour as hard to substitute those <em>that will keep
them there</em>. There is a dilemma here, which is not easily got over;
and to solve the difficulty and reconcile the contradiction, was the
great problem of the late King’s reign. The doubtful lubricity of
Mr. Canning’s style was one of the rollers by which the transition
was effected, and Legitimacy shown to be a middle term between
<em>divine right</em> and <em>the choice of the people</em>, compatible with both, and
convertible into either, at the discretion of the Crown, or pleasure of
the speaker. Mr. Canning does not disgrace his pretensions on other
questions. He is a sophist by profession, a palliator of every powerful
and profitable abuse. His shuffling, trifling speeches on Reform are
well-known. He sometimes adds the petulance of the school-boy to
his stock of worn-out invention; though his unfeeling taunt on the
‘revered and ruptured Ogden,’ met with a reception which will make
him cautious how he tampers again with human infirmity and individual
suffering, as the subject of ribald jests and profligate alliteration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thing in which Mr. Canning excels most is wit; and his wit
is confined to parody. The <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite> have been much and
deservedly admired; but we do not think the parodies in them, however
ingenious or ludicrous, are to be compared with those in the
‘<cite>Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin</cite>,’ and some of the very best of these are
by Mr. Canning. Among others are, we believe, the <em>German Play</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>and the imitation of Mr. Southey’s <cite>Sapphics</cite>. Much as we admire,
we do not wonder at Mr. Canning’s excellence in this department.
Real, original wit, he has none; for that implies sense and feeling,
and an insight into the real differences of things; but from a want of
sympathy with anything but forms and <em>common-places</em>, he can easily let
down the sense of others so as to make <em>nonsense</em> of it. He has no
enthusiasm or sensibility to make him overlook the meanness of a
subject, or a little irregularity in the treatment of it, from the interest
it excites: to a mind like his, the serious and affecting is a kind of
natural burlesque. It is a matter of course for him to be struck with
the absurdity of the romantic or singular in any way, to whom every
thing out of the beaten track is absurd; and ‘to turn what is serious
into farce’ by transferring the same expressions to perfectly indifferent
and therefore contemptible subjects. To make any description or
sentiment ludicrous, it is only necessary to take away all feeling from
it: the ludicrous is ready-made to Mr. Canning’s hands. The poetry,
the heart-felt interest of every thing escapes through his apprehension,
like a snake out of its skin, and leaves the slough of parody behind it.
Any thing more light or worthless cannot well be imagined.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c009'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Vivian Grey is dedicated to the Best and Greatest of men, as if the
Illustrious Person who will take this compliment to himself approved
of the sentiments contained in it. Are ushers odious to the Best and
Greatest of men? Does he hate the great mass of his subjects, and
scorn all those beyond Temple-bar? Is he King only of the Dandies,
and Monarch of the West? We scarcely believe it. This volume
with its impertinent dedication is no more expressive of the sentiments
of his heart than the <cite>Austrian Catechism</cite>, dedicated in like manner,
would be characteristic of the principles of his reign. Oh! Mr.
Grey, you should have been more humble—you should have inscribed
your work to the best-dressed Man in his Majesty’s dominions—or to
Jack Ketch.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was formerly understood to be the business of literature to
enlarge the bounds of knowledge and feeling; to direct the mind’s
eye beyond the present moment and the present object; to plunge us
in the world of romance, to connect different languages, manners,
times together; to wean us from the grossness of sense, the illusions of
self-love;—by the aid of imagination, to place us in the situations of
others and enable us to feel an interest in all that strikes them; and
to make books the faithful witnesses and interpreters of nature and the
human heart. Of late, instead of this liberal and useful tendency, it
has taken a narrower and more superficial tone. All that we learn
from it is the servility, egotism, and upstart pretensions of the writers.
Instead of transporting you to faery-land or into the <em>middle ages</em>, you
take a turn down Bond Street or go through the mazes of the dance
at Almack’s. You have no new inlet to thought or feeling opened to
you; but the passing object, the topic of the day (however insipid or
repulsive) is served up to you with a self-sufficient air, as if you had
not already had enough of it. You dip into an Essay or a Novel,
and may fancy yourself reading a collection of quack or fashionable
advertisements:—Macassar Oil, Eau de Cologne, Hock and Seltzer
Water, Otto of Roses, <cite>Pomade Divine</cite> glance through the page in
inextricable confusion, and make your head giddy. Far from
extending your sympathies, they are narrowed to a single point, the
admiration of the folly, caprice, insolence, and affectation of a certain
class;—so that with the exception of people who ride in their
carriages, you are taught to look down upon the rest of the species
with indifference, abhorrence, or contempt. A school-master in a
black coat is a monster—a tradesman and his wife who eat cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>mutton and pickled cabbage are wretches to be hunted out of society.
That is the end and moral of it: it is part and parcel of a system.
The <em>Dandy School</em> give the finishing touch to the principles of
paternal government. First comes the political sycophant, and makes
the people over to their rulers as a property in perpetuity; but then
they are to be handled tenderly, and need not complain, since the
sovereign is the father of his people, and we are to be all one family
of love. So says the <cite>Austrian Catechism</cite>. Then comes the literary
sycophant to finish what the other had begun; and the poor fools of
people having been caught in the trap of plausible professions, he
takes off the mask of <em>paternity</em>, treats them as of a different species
instead of members of the same family, loads them with obloquy and
insult, and laughs at the very idea of any fellow feeling with or consideration
towards them, as the height of bad taste, weakness, and
vulgarity. So say Mr. Theodore Hook and the author of <cite>Vivian
Grey</cite>. So says not Sir Walter. Ever while you live, go to a man
of genius in preference to a dunce; for let his prejudices or his party
be what they may, there is still a saving grace about him, for he
himself has something else to trust to besides his subserviency to
greatness to raise him from insignificance. He takes you and places
you in a cottage or a cavern, and makes you feel the deepest interest
in it, for you feel all that its inmates feel. The <cite>Dandy School</cite> tell you
all that a dandy would feel in such circumstances, viz. that he was not
in a drawing-room or at Long’s. Or if he does forfeit his character
for a moment, he at most brings himself to patronise humanity, condescends
to the accidents of common life, touches the pathetic with
his pen as if it were with a pair of tongs, and while he just deigns to
notice the existence or endure the infirmities of his fellow-creatures,
indemnifies his vanity by snatching a conscious glance at his own
person and perfections. Whatever is going on, he himself is the hero
of the scene; the distress (however excruciating) derives its chief
claim to attention from the singular circumstance of his being present;
and he manages the whole like a piece of private theatricals with an air
of the most absolute <em>nonchalance</em> and decorum. The <span class='sc'>Whole Duty of
Man</span> is turned into a butt and bye-word, or like Mr. Martin’s bill for
humanity to animals, is a pure voluntary, a caprice of effeminate
sensibility: the great business of life is a kind of masquerade or
melo-drame got up for effect and by particular desire of the Great.
We soon grow tired of nature so treated, and are glad to turn to the
follies and fopperies of high life, into which the writer enters with
more relish, and where he finds himself more at home. So Mr.
Croker (in his place in the House of Commons) does not know
where Bloomsbury Square is: thus affecting to level all the houses in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the metropolis that are not at the court-end, and leaving them
tenantless by a paltry sneer, as if a plague had visited them. It is no
wonder that his <i><span lang="fr">protégés</span></i> and understrappers out of doors should echo
this official impertinence—draw the line still closer between the East
and West-end—arrest a stray sentiment at the corner of a street,
relegate elegance to a fashionable square—annihilate all other enjoyments,
all other pretensions but those of their employers—reduce the
bulk of mankind to a cypher, and make all but a few pampered
favourites of fortune dissatisfied with themselves and contemptible to
one another. The reader’s mind is so varnished over with affectation
that not an avenue to truth or feeling is left open, and it is stifled for
want of breath. Send these people across the Channel who make
such a fuss about the East and West-end, and no one can find out the
difference.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c009'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The English are not a nation of <em>dandies</em>; nor can John
Bull afford (whatever the panders to fashion and admirers of courtly
graces may say to the contrary) to rest all his pretensions upon that.
He must descend to a broader and more manly level to keep his
ground at all. Those who would persuade him to build up his
fame on frogged coats or on the embellishments of a snuff-box, he
should scatter with one loud roar of indignation and trample into
the earth like grasshoppers, as making not only a beast but an ass
of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>A writer of this accomplished stamp, comes forward to tell you,
not how his hero feels on any occasion, for he is above that, but how
he was dressed, and makes him a mere lay-figure of fashion with a
few pert, current phrases in his mouth. The Sir Sedley Clarendels
and Meadowses of a former age are become the real fine gentlemen of
this. Then he gives you the address of his heroine’s milliner, lest
any shocking surmise should arise in your mind of the possibility of
her dealing with a person of less approved taste, and also informs you
that the quality eat fish with silver forks. This is all he knows about
the matter: is this all they feel? The fact is new to him: it is old
to them. It is so new to him and he is so delighted with it, that
provided a few select persons eat fish with silver forks, he considers it
a circumstance of no consequence if a whole country starves: but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>these privileged persons are not surely thinking all the time and every
day of their lives of that which Mr. Theodore Hook has never
forgotten since he first witnessed it, viz. that <em>they eat their fish with a
silver fork</em>. What then are they thinking of in their intervals of
leisure—what are their feelings that <em>we</em> can be supposed to know
nothing of? Will Mr. Theodore Hook, who is ‘comforted with
their bright radiance, though not in their sphere,’ condescend to give
us a glimpse of these, that we may admire their real elegance and
refinement as much as he does a frogged coat or silver fork? It is
cruel in him not to do so. ‘The <em>court</em>, as well as we, may chide
him for it.’ He once criticised a city feast with great minuteness
and bitterness, in which (as it appears) the side-board is ill-arranged,
the footman makes a blunder, the cook has sent up a dish too little or
too highly seasoned. Something is wanting, as Mr. Hook insinuates
is necessarily the case whenever people in the neighbourhood of
Russell square give dinners. But that something is not the manners
or conversation of gentlemen—this never enters his head—but something
that the butler, the cook or the valet of people of fashion could
have remedied quite as well (to say the least) as their masters. It is
here the cloven foot, the under-bred tone, the undue admiration of
external circumstances breaks out and betrays the writer. Mr. Hook
has a fellow-feeling with low life or rather with vulgarity aping
gentility, but he has never got beyond the outside of what he calls
<em>good society</em>. He can lay the cloth or play the buffoon after dinner—but
that is the utmost he can pretend to. We have in <cite>Sayings and
Doings</cite> and in <cite>Vivian Grey</cite> abundance of Lady Marys and Lady
Dorothys, but they are titles without characters, or the blank is filled
up with the most trite impertinence. So a young linen-draper or
attorney’s clerk from the country, who had gained a thirty thousand
pound prize in the lottery and wished to set up for a fine gentleman,
might learn from these Novels what hotel to put up at, what watering
place to go to, what hatter, hosier, tailor, shoemaker, <em>friseur</em> to
employ, what part of the town he should be seen in, what theatre he
might frequent; but how to behave, speak, look, feel and think in his
new and more aspiring character he would not find the most distant
hint in the gross caricatures or flimsy sketches of the most mechanical
and shallow of all schools. It is really as if, in lieu of our royal and
fashionable ‘Society of Authors,’ a deputation of tailors, cooks,
lacqueys, had taken possession of Parnassus, and had appointed some
Abigail out of place perpetual Secretary. The Congreves, Wycherleys,
and Vanbrughs of former days gave us some taste of gentility and
courtly refinement in their plays: enchanted us with their <em>Millamants</em>,
or made us bow with respect to their <em>Lord Townleys</em>. It would seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>that the race of these is over, or that our modern scribes have not had
access to them on a proper footing—that is, not for their talents or
conversation, but as mountebanks or political drudges.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first it appears strange that persons of so low a station in life
should be seized with such a rage to inveigh against themselves, and
make us despise all but a few arrogant people, who pay them ill for
what they do. But this is the natural process of servility, and we see
all valets and hangers-on of the Great do the same thing. The
powdered footman looks down on the rabble that dog his master’s
coach as beneath his notice. He feels the one little above him, and
the other (by consequence) infinitely below him. Authors at present
would be thought gentlemen, as gentlemen have a fancy to turn
authors. The first thing a <em>dandy scribbler</em> does is to let us know he
is dressed in the height of the fashion (otherwise we might imagine
him some miserable garretteer, distinguished only by his poverty and
learning)—and the next thing he does is to make a supercilious
allusion to some one who is not so well dressed as himself. He then
proceeds to give us a sparkling account of his Champagne and of his
box at the Opera. A newspaper hack of this description also takes
care to inform us that the people at the Opera in general, the
Mr. Smiths and the Mr. Browns, are not good enough for him, and
that he shall wait to begin his critical lucubrations, till the stars of
fashion meet there in crowds and constellations! At present, it should
seem that a seat on Parnassus conveys a title to a box at the Opera,
and that Helicon no longer runs water but champagne. Literature, so
far from supplying us with intellectual resources to counterbalance
immediate privations, is made an instrument to add to our impatience
and irritability under them, and to nourish our feverish, childish
admiration of external show and grandeur. This rage for fashion
and for fashionable writing seems becoming universal, and some stop
must be put to it, unless it cures itself by its own excessive folly and
insipidity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well that the Editor of the <cite>John Bull</cite> wrote the <cite>Sayings and
Doings</cite>. It solves the problem with how small a quantity of wit a
person without character or principle may set up for a political
mouthpiece. Nothing but the dullness of the one could account for
the impudence and the effect of the other. No one who could write
a line of wit or sense could bring himself from any inducement to
repeat the same nickname, the same stale jest, for weeks and months
together. If the Editor of the <cite>John Bull</cite> had any resources in himself
beyond the most vulgar <em>slang</em> and hackneyed abuse, if he had any
sense of shame at resorting to the same wretched pun or more wretched
calumny, week after week, as he is paid for it, he would be unfit for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>his task: he would no longer be the complete and unequivocal organ
of the dulness, prejudices, malice, and callous insensibility of his party.
No argument tells with a minister of State like calling a man a Jacobin
and a Reformer for the fortieth time: the sleek Divine chuckles at a
dirty allusion for the fortieth time with unabated glee. Mr. Hook,
among wits, might be called <em>the parson’s nose</em>: or perhaps the title of
Mr. Vivacity Dull would suit him as well. What a dearth of
invention, what a want of interest, what a fuss about nothing, what a
dreary monotony, what a pert <em>slipslop</em> jargon runs through the whole
series of the author’s tales! But what a persevering, unabashed
confidence, what a broad-shouldered self-complacency, what robust
health, what unrelenting nerves he must possess to inflict them on his
readers! Not one ray, not one line—but all the refuse of the
<em>Green-room</em>, the locomotions of a booth at a fair, the humours of a
Margate hoy, the grimace of a jack-pudding, the sentimentalities and
hashed-up scandal of a lady’s maid, the noise and hurry of a chaise
and four, the <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i> and vacancy of a return post-chaise! The smart
<em>improvisatori</em> turns out the most wearisome of interminable writers. At
a moment’s warning he can supply something that is worth nothing,
and in ten times the space he can spin out ten times the quantity
of the same poor trash. Would the public read <cite>Sayings and Doings</cite>?
Would Mr. Colburn print them? No, but they are known to be the
work of the Editor of the <cite>John Bull</cite>, of that great and anonymous
abstract of wit, taste, and patriotism, who, like a Ministerial trull,
calls after you in the street, dubs Mr. Waithman Lord Waithman,
cries <em>Humbug</em> whenever humanity is mentioned; invades the peace of
private life, out of regard to religion and social order; cuts a throat
out of good-nature, and laughs at it; and claps his Majesty familiarly
on the shoulder, as the best of Kings! Do you wonder at the face,
the gravity, the impenetrable assurance required to do all this, and to
do it not once, but once a week? Read <cite>Sayings and Doings</cite>, and the
wonder ceases; you see it is because he can do nothing else! He
will feel obliged to us for this character: his patrons were beginning
to forget his qualifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>We once happened to be present, and indeed to assist in the following
conversation between a young lady and an elderly gentleman
pretty much of our own standing in such matters. ‘I believe, papa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>grand-papa did not think so highly of Mr. Garrick as most people
did?’ ‘Why, my dear, your grand-papa was not one of those who
liked to differ very openly with the world; but he had an opinion
of his own, which he imparted only to a few particular friends. He
really thought Mr. Garrick was a quack, a better sort of Barthelemy-fair
actor. He used to say (for he was a man that knew the world)
‘that the real secret of Mr. Garrick’s success was, that his friend
Bate Dudley had puffed him into notice, as he afterwards did the
Prince of Wales.’ We on this observed, in our individual capacity,
that at least the dispenser of popularity had been more successful in
the one case than in the other. ‘I believe, papa, you yourself were
never a great admirer of Mrs. Siddons?’ ‘Why no, my dear, one
does not like to say those things, but she always appeared to me
one of the great impositions on the world. There was nothing in
her, a mere tragedy-queen.’—‘Pray, ma’am, have you read Sir
Walter’s last novel?’—‘Why no, I really cannot say I have. I
have tried to get through one or two, but I find them so dry I have
given up the attempt. I like “Sayings and Doings” much better.
Pray, sir, can you tell me the name of the author?’ ‘Mr. Theodore
Hook.’—‘Bless me, what a pretty name; I wish papa would invite
him to dinner.’—Here we have the genealogy of modern taste.
’Fore gad, they were all in a story—three generations in succession
thinking nothing of Garrick, Mrs. Siddons, and the author of
‘Waverley,’ and preferring Mr. Theodore Hook before the quintessence
of truth and nature. And such is the opinion of nine-tenths
of the world, if we could get at their real thoughts. The vulgar in
their inmost souls admire nothing but the vulgar; the common-place
admire nothing but the common-place; the superficial nothing but the
superficial. How should it be otherwise? The rest is cant and
affectation: and as to those who know better and have pretensions
themselves, they are actuated by envy and malice, or some preconceived
theory of their own. Instead of a great actor, for instance,
they are looking for a hat and feather, are disappointed at not finding
what they fondly expect, and more disappointed still at coming in
collision with a power that shocks all their previous sympathies,
rules, and definitions. Let a great man ‘fall into misfortune’ (like
<em>Captain Macheath</em>) and then you discover the real dispositions of the
reading, seeing, believing, loving public towards their pretended idol.
See how they set upon him the moment he is down, how they watch
for the smallest slip, the first pretext to pick a quarrel with him, how
slow they are to acknowledge worth, how they never forgive an
error, how they trample upon and tear ‘to tatters, to very rags,’ the
common frailties, how they overlook and malign the transcendant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>excellence which they can neither reach nor find a substitute for!
Who has praised Sir Walter, who has not had a <em>fling</em> at him, since
he lost all that he was worth? Oh! if he would but write the
‘Life of George <span class='fss'>IV.</span>!’ Who that had felt Kean’s immeasurable
superiority in <cite>Othello</cite>, was not glad to see him brought to the ordinary
level in a vulgar <em>crim. con</em>? No: a man of true genius and common
observation, instead of being disappointed at not carrying the prize by
acclamation, and exciting gratitude equal to the pleasure he gives,
ought to be thankful that he is not hooted from the stage, and torn in
pieces by the rabble, as soon as he quits his lair of solitary obscurity.
Every man of that sort is assuredly looked upon by the vulgar as
having dealings with the devil, because they do not see ‘the spells,
the mighty magic he hath used’ and they would make an <em>auto-da-fé</em>
of him if they durst, as they formerly burnt a witch! They contrive
to torture him enough, as it is. What was it made men burn
astrologers and alchemists in former times, but the sense of power
and knowledge which the illiterate hind did not possess? Are the
<em>reading</em> different from the <em>unreading</em> public? Believe it not. But
this power was supposed to be exercised for evil purposes, whereas
genius has a beneficial influence. <em>That</em> doubles the obligation, and
fixes the ingratitude. The critical public view the appearance of an
original mind with the sidelong glances and the <i><span lang="fr">doux yeux</span></i> with which
the animals at Exeter-’Change regard the strange visitants; but if any
one trusting to the amiable looks and playful gambols of the one or
the other opens the door of his own folly to let them out, he will
soon see how it will fare with him. There are a million of people
in this single metropolis, each of whom would willingly stand on the
pedestal which you occupy. Will they forgive you for thrusting
them from their place, or not triumph if they see you totter? Beware
how you climb the slippery ascent; do not neglect your footing when
you are there. Such is the natural feeling; and then comes the
philosophical critic, and tells you with a face of lead and brass that
‘no more indulgence is to be shewn to the indiscretions of a man of
genius than to any other!’ What! you make him drunk and mad
with applause and then blame him for not being sober, you lift him to
a pinnacle, and then say he is not to be giddy, you own he is to be a
creature of impulse, and yet you would regulate him like a machine,
you expect him to be all fire and air, to wing the empyrean, and to
take you with him, and yet you would have him a muck-worm
crawling the earth! But it is a Scotch critic who says this—let us
pass on. If an actor is indeed six feet high, with a face like a pasteboard
mask, he may pass in the crowd and will have the mob on his
side; but if he can only boast</p>

<p class='c016'>he stands in equal peril of the unthinking many, and the fastidious
few. Or, if an actress is a foreigner, she may escape ‘the envy of
less happier lands,’ and be encouraged as a luxury for the great—be
wafted to us on a name, and take back with her our sighs and tears.
Yet how frail is the tenure of fashion! Where is Madame Catalani
now? Where does the siren’s voice flutter in the sunshine of her
smiles?—</p>

<p class='c007'>It was some time since we had seen Mr. Kean’s <em>Shylock</em>. Fourteen
years ago we were desired to go and see a young actor from the
country attempt the part at Drury-lane; and, as was expected, add
another to the list of failures. When we got there, there were about
fifty people in the pit, and there was that sense of previous damnation
which a thin house inspires. When the new candidate came on,
there was a lightness in his step, an airy buoyancy and self-possession
different from the sullen, dogged, <em>gaol-delivery</em> look of the traditional
<em>Shylocks</em> of the stage. A vague expectation was excited, and all went
on well; but it was not till he came to the part, when leaning on his
staff, he tells the tale of Jacob and his flock with the garrulous ease
of old age and an animation of spirit, that seems borne back to the
olden time, and to the privileged example in which he exults, that it
was plain that a man of genius had lighted on the stage. To those
who had the spirit and candour to hail the lucky omen, the recollection
of that moment of startling, yet welcome surprise, will always be
a proud and satisfactory one. We wished to see after a lapse of time
and other changes, whether this first impression would still keep
‘true touch,’ and we find no difference. Besides the excellence of
the impassioned parts of Mr. Kean’s acting, there is a flexibility
and indefiniteness of outline about it, like a figure with a landscape
back-ground—he is in Venice with his money-bags, his daughter and
his injuries, but his thoughts take wing to the East, his voice swells
and deepens at the mention of his sacred tribe and ancient law, and
he dwells delighted on any digression to distant times and places, as
a relief to his vindictive and rooted purposes. Of all Mr. Kean’s
performances, we think this the most faultless and least <em>mannered</em>,
always excepting his <cite>Othello</cite>, which is equally perfect and twenty
times more powerful. Mr. Kean succeeded so well in this part in
which he came out, that with the diffidence of the abilities of others
so natural to us, it was concluded by the managers he could do
nothing else, and he was kept in it so long that he had nearly failed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>in <em>Richard</em>, till the dying scene bore down all opposition by a
withering spell, and as if a preternatural being had visibly taken
possession of his form, and made the enthusiasm the greater from the
uncertainty that had before prevailed. The <em>Sir Giles Overreach</em>
stamped him with the players and the town, and <cite>Othello</cite> with the
critics. He who has done a single thing that others never forget,
and feel ennobled whenever they think of, need not regret his having
been, and may throw aside this fleshly coil, like any other worn-out
part, grateful and contented!</p>

<p class='c007'>Monsieur Perlet is certainly a pearl of an actor. He does every
part well, and every part varied from another. He is, however, a
jewel set in lead: the rest of the company to which he belongs are
but indifferent. He is exactly what a London <em>star</em>, engaged for a
few nights to gratify the ‘upturned eyes of wondering audiences,’ is
in a tattered troop of country-actors. Those who fancy that they see
here a thorough sample of French acting, the <em>elite</em> of the capital of
civilised society, are mistaken; and we perhaps should not undeceive
them, but that we can assure them that they have a pleasure to come,
something to look forward to, and something to look back upon, and
which (we believe) can be found only at Paris. Oh! Paris, thou
hast the Louvre, the garden of the Thuilleries, and the <i><span lang="fr">Thêatre
Français</span></i>; Madame Pasta we share by turns with you, as the sun
sheds its light on either world—the rest is barbarous and common.
A friend of ours once received a letter from a friend of his, dated
<span class='sc'>Rome</span>, with three marks of admiration after it, which he answered
by writing <span class='sc'>London</span>, with four marks of admiration after it: ‘and
why shouldn’t he, since we had St. Paul’s, the Cartoons, the Elgin
Marbles, and the Bridges?’ As to the three first, they were not
ours; and as to the fourth, the reasoning puts me a little in mind of
Sir William Curtis’s, who remarked that ‘it was very good of God,
that wherever there was a great city, he had made a river by the side
of it!’ There was another proud distinction, which our patriotic
friend did not enumerate, though it was a thumping make-weight in
the scale, and might have claimed a fifth mark of admiration, which
was, that he himself was there. This is the triumphant argument in
every Englishman’s imagination,—wherever he is, is the centre of
gravity; whatever he calls his own, is the standard of excellence.
It is our desire to shake off this feeling as much as possible that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>makes us frequent the theatre at the English Opera-house, and try (all
we can) to ‘leave our country and ourselves’ at the door. Why in
truth should an English Nobleman be convinced in himself and speak
upon that conviction in his place in Parliament, that because he keeps
a French cook, the French have no genius for anything but cookery?
Or why, my dear Madam, should you have taken it in your head,
that because you wear a French bonnet, there is nothing in Paris but
milliners’ girls who are no better than they should be? Nay, that is
what you really imagine, however you may deny it—but be assured,
good, gentle, honest, reflecting reader of either sex, who feel your
own existence so solid that every thing else is a fable to it, or your
own virtue so clear that everything else is a spot to it, that there are
things out of England besides what are imported into it—that French
women not only make caps and bonnets, but wear them with a
peculiar grace; that they have eyes glancing from under them full of
fire and discretion; that they do not make a false step at every turn,
though they do not walk like Englishwomen, that is, as if their limbs
were an incumbrance to them; that the Chamber of Deputies think
your Lordship’s speeches dry and tasteless, for want of a little French
seasoning; that there are cities not built of bricks, faces not made of
dough, a language that has a meaning though it is not ours, and virtue
that is neither a statue nor a mask! For instance, we think good-manners
is one part of ethics, and we do wish <i><span lang="la">en passant</span></i> that our fine
gentlemen at the play would not loll on their seats, whistle, and
thrust their sticks nearly in your face to show their superiority to the
vulgar; and that those of the other sex, who are admitted on their
good behaviour could be prevailed on not to talk and laugh so loud,
not to nod or wink, not to slap their acquaintance on the back, or
shut the doors with such violence after them, to attract admirers and
shew an independent spirit. Strange that the English notion of independence
consists in giving offence to and displaying your contempt
for others! They order these things better in France, where they
consult decency of appearance at least, and Venus is a prude in public—not
a hoyden or a bully!</p>

<p class='c007'>This brings us back to the French Theatre. As we do not
approve every thing foreign or French, we are more bound to
acknowledge and do justice to what we do like. <i><span lang="la">Imprimis</span></i>, we abhor
French pictures. In the second place, we tolerate French tragedy.
Thirdly, we adore French comedy. The characteristic of this in its
best state, and as compared with our utmost efforts in the same line,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>is, that it is equally perfect throughout; and as that great philosopher
of idleness (Mr. Coleridge) once wisely and wittily observed, ‘there
is something in the idea of perfection exceedingly satisfactory to the
mind of man.’ It is not as with us at present (it was not always so—or
is it the haze of time, the tints of youth that made the
difference?) where the most we can expect is one or two actors of
disproportioned excellence, and all the others merely to fill the stage;
but there all are in their place, and all are first-rate. Oh! it is a
fine thing to see one of Moliere’s comedies acted (as they should be)
at the <i><span lang="fr">Thêatre Français</span></i>, with the sense of every pregnant line fully
understood and developed, with the passion and character delineated
to the life, every situation painted, and every shade and difference of
absurdity hit off and realised; and not only this, but the whole so
managed, with such studious attention to the public and respect to
the art, that not the least bit of costume is out of place, and (what is
more important) that every part is filled by an actor or actress not
only who comprehends and enters into the spirit of it, but who seems
made for it in person, gesture and features, as if they had been cast
in a dramatic mould, or kept in a glass-case for that purpose from the
first representation to the present day. Thus the long, nasal speeches
are delivered by an actor with the prominent, pasteboard nose and
arched eyebrows of the Oratory, and whose unusual height and
shambling figure serve him as it were for a rostrum; the poetical
dedicator in the <em>Misanthrope</em> has sparkling eyes and teeth, smiling
delighted on his patron and himself; the confidante of <em>Celimene</em>, in
the same piece, is slender, fragile, timid in appearance, a contrast to
the firm precision and maturer <em>enbon-point</em> of Mademoiselle Mars;
Orgon has a little, round, dimpled, credulous face, and easy contented
corpulence; the <em>Tartuffe</em> has the sneaking sanctity of a monk and the
grin of a monkey. Thus you have not only the poet’s verse exactly
expressed and recited; but you have, in addition, the natural history
of the part, the drapery, the grouping. The age of Louis XIV.
revives again in all its masqued splendour; the folding-doors are
thrown open, and you see men and women playing the fool deliciously,
‘new manners and the pomp of elder days,’ court-airs, court-dresses,
the strut, the shrug, the bow, the curtsey, the paint, the powder, the
patches, the perfume, the laced ruffles, the diamond buckle, the
hoop-petticoat. Happy time! Enviable time to think of! When
vanity and folly expanded in full bloom, and were spread out
ostentatiously like the figures in a gaudy tapestry, instead of being
folded up and thrust into a corner by the hand of a cynic and austere
philosophy; when personal appearance and amorous intrigue were all
in all; when a marquis stalked the God of his own idolatry, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span><em>Madame la Marquise</em> was held for something divine by <em>Monsieur
Jourdain</em>; when the whole creation was supposed to be concentred
in the fantastic circle of lords and ladies, and the universal, the
abstract, and the critical were held in the utter contempt which they
deserve—and which they receive at the hands both of the ignorant
and the adept! Nothing that we know of is a specific for conjuring
up this shadow of the past, and making you (if you are in the mood)
feel like a great booby school-boy, with a large <em>bouquet</em> at your breast,
or an antiquated fop with a bag-wig and sword—but sitting at the
<i><span lang="fr">Thêatre Français</span></i> with Mademoiselle Mars and the whole <i><span lang="fr">corps
dramatique</span></i> drawn up on the stage. Then you have the very thing
before you: it glitters in your eyes; it tingles in your ears, it sinks
into the heart, and makes warm tears roll down the cheek of those,
who have ever felt either what the present or the past is! It is said
to be an ill wind that blows nobody good; and probably we owe it
to the very exclusion of French players from general society, and
their being compelled in self-defence to devote themselves wholly to
their profession, that they keep up this sort of traditional copy of the
manners, peculiarities, and tone of another age, ‘unmixed with baser
matter.’ We could wish that a certain happy-spirited writer (who
first gave the true <em>pine-apple</em> flavour to theatrical criticism, making it a
pleasant mixture of sharp and sweet) would resume the subject of the
age of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> (our nearest approach to that of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>) and as
he has shocked the upstart petulance of <em>Some of his Contemporaries</em>,
restore in his inimitable careless manner the wit and graces of a
former period.</p>

<p class='c007'>We expected to have seen Monsieur Perlet on Thursday evening
in the <cite><span lang="fr">Bourgeois Gentilhomme</span></cite>; and to make sure of the ground, had
read three acts in the morning with great care and an anticipated
relish of the acting. We were therefore disappointed; and the
reader must accept of a rhapsody in lieu of a criticism. We think it
bad policy to have many new pieces; for the English part of the
audience in general require to peruse the text beforehand in order to
follow the performance. We like to know exactly what we are
about; and it is both a pride and a pleasure to have an excuse for
rubbing up our acquaintance with an old and esteemed author. The
universality of the French language is not an unalloyed advantage to
them: it saves the trouble of learning any other, but the necessity of
acquiring a new language is like the necessity of acquiring a new
sense. It is an increase of knowledge and liberality. We are proud
of understanding their authors. Why do they despise ours? Because
they are ignorant of them. If they had known what ‘stuff’ we are
made of, very likely we should not have beaten them. M. Perlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>played the part of a strolling comedian in the new piece of the
<em>Landau</em>, and eats and drinks in an admirable <i><span lang="it">bravura</span></i> style at a
gentleman’s house on the road, where he passes himself off as a great
man, and with that lively absorption in the present enjoyment and
disregard of the consequences of his imposture, which are, we
suspect, national traits. In the <em>Landes</em> which followed, he was
equally happy in a poor, frightened servant, and expressed the
surprises of fear and the tricks and disjointed pantomime antics, to
which it resorted to screen itself, with admirable quaintness and
drollery. The swagger and self-possession of the one character was
totally opposed to the imbecility and helplessness of the other.
Madame Falcoz made her first appearance in the <cite>Tyran Domestique</cite>
as <em>Madame Valmont</em>. She is an elegant woman and an interesting
actress, though with too much appearance of <em>still-life</em>. This is not
the case with Madame Daudel. She has all the vivacity and bustle
of a chambermaid. She ought always to come in with a broom in
her hand; or rather, it is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>We exhausted that subject last week, and were complimented
upon it, which we took ill. Probably advisable to be ill this
week, to let our absence be felt, or to make up with scraps and
quotation. To transcribe four different accounts of the <em>Tartuffe</em>,
Sir Walter Scott’s, Mr. Leigh Hunt’s, Monsieur Perlet’s, and one
of our own, and to make it understood that the last is the best. To
remark that Monsieur Perlet, ‘that soul of pleasure and that life of
whim,’ is a provoking actor—for there is no fault to be found with
him, and to give the reader an idea of his peculiar excellence is next
to impossible. Whatever he does, his ease, self-possession, and
spirit are the same. To make it a rule not to tell any one who asks
me the plot of the <cite>Ecole des Maris</cite>, but to tell it myself. Borrowers
of plots are like borrowers of snuff:—every one his own <em>box-keeper</em>.
(<em>Ha, ha, ha!</em>) The laugh here comes from a friend of ours to
whom we read this, and who kept repeating the whole evening—‘Every
man his own box-keeper.’ (<em>Ha, ha, ha!</em>) Very well
indeed. <em>Sganarelle</em> and <em>Ariste</em> are two brothers, both of them in
years, who have two wards, <em>Isabelle</em> and <em>Leonore</em>, whom they propose
to marry. <em>Sganarelle</em> is an old blockhead, who brings up his intended
bride with the greatest severity, and will let her see no plays,
go to no balls, receive no visits, lest it should corrupt her manners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>or divert her affection from him. He is very angry at his brother
<em>Ariste</em>, who gives full liberty to his mistress <em>Leonore</em>, and contends
that bars, bolts, female Arguses, and ill-humour are not the way to
make women in love with virtue, or to prevent their inclination from
wandering. <em>Sganarelle</em> laughs at him, but he turns out a true prophet.
<em>Isabelle</em>, not thinking the <em>disagreeable</em> the most <em>agreeable</em> thing in the
world, meets with a lover (<em>Valere</em>) more to her mind than her guardian.
And here begins the interest of the plot. Having no other mode
of communication, she sends <em>Sganarelle</em> to him, to let him know that
she is apprized of the state of his affections, and to beg him not
to persecute her with his amorous thoughts, if he has any regard for
her honour or peace of mind. He understands the hint, and sends
the supposed husband away, delighted with his confusion and repulse,
who has no sooner returned to his intended, than she desires him
to go back with a letter, which <em>Ariste</em> has just had the assurance
to send her in his absence, full of his absurd passion. This <em>Sganarelle</em>
consents to do, but proposes to open the letter first, which she will
not allow him to do, saying it would betray curiosity to break the
seal, and no woman of virtue should feel even a wish to know the
improper sentiments entertained towards her. Her guardian delivers
the letter with an air of triumph and pity for his rival, which <em>Valere</em>
reads, and finds it a frank and passionate declaration of <em>Isabelle’s</em>
attachment to him. Not satisfied with this, she informs <em>Sganarelle</em>
that he has a design to carry her off by force, who goes to reproach
him with the baseness of his conduct and the pretended terror and
uneasiness of his ward. <em>Valere</em> affirming that <em>Sganarelle</em> has no
authority to bring him these disdainful messages from the lady, <em>Sganarelle</em>
brings them together in his presence, when an admirable scene of
<em>double-entendre</em> follows: <em>Isabelle</em> declaring that she sees two objects
before her, one which she adores, the other which she abhors,
<em>Sganarelle</em> taking to himself the preference which is intended for
<em>Valere</em>, and the latter rapturously kissing her hand behind his back,
while her guardian affectionately embraces her. But in recompense
for her fondness, he proposes to marry her the next day instead of at
the end of eight days; and this driving <em>Isabelle</em> to despair, she takes
the resolution to quit the house in the middle of the night, but is met
by her guardian, who asking the meaning of this nocturnal expedition,
she tells him that her sister has come to her house, violently in love
with <em>Valere</em>, whom she is going in search of, to console her; but
<em>Sganarelle</em> not being satisfied with this assignation, will not allow her to
remain, and presently after turns his own bride out of doors, thinking it
to be his brother’s ward <em>Leonore</em>, and goes with great glee to inform
<em>Ariste</em> of the adventure, and to lecture him on the difference of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>schemes of female education. In the meantime <em>Leonore</em> comes in
from a ball, is scandalized at the story that she hears told of her;
and the Notary that <em>Sganarelle</em> had sent for to witness her elopement
and the treachery of <em>Valere</em>, having married him to <em>Isabelle</em>, she
comes out from his house, and explains the whole mystery to the
delight of every one but <em>Sganarelle</em>.—The plot is charming, and the
style is profuse of sense and wit; but there is this remark to be made
here, as on other of Moliere’s plays, that however elegant, ingenious,
or natural, the scene must be laid in France, that the whole passes
under that empire of words, which is confined to her airy limits, and
that there is a credulous and unqualified assent to verbal professions
necessary to carry on the plot, which can be found nowhere but in
France. This comedy was correctly but somewhat faintly represented.
Mademoiselle Falcoz, who played <em>Isabelle</em>, was dressed
as we have an idea servants were formerly dressed, with a full
handkerchief and a black silk apron. Perhaps it was the costume of
young ladies at that period; but we suspect that this is carrying
literal correctness too far, where it shocks instead of assisting the
imagination, and instructing us at the expense of our amusement,
which is against the law of dramatic propriety. If the play was not
done quite as it might be, it received a brilliant comment from the
looks of some of the audience: and as the stage is a mirror to
nature, so these are a mirror to the stage itself. Bright eyes!
Laughing lips! Tell-tale eyebrows! spare us or we retire incontinently
from the French play,—‘To the woods, to the waves, to
the winds we’ll complain’ of your inexorable cruelty and endless
persecution!</p>

<p class='c007'>This being <em>Passion-week</em>, there was no play. ‘Because thou art
virtuous, shall we not have cakes and ale?’ In truth, however, we
have no objection to this alternation of festivity and mourning: it
mimics the order of the natural world. We require a truce with
pleasure as well as pain, to enable us to endure the one or to enjoy
the other: and we must put a stop at some period or other to the
whirl of dissipation, unless we would grow quite stupid or giddy.
One week out of the fifty-two, in which the theatres shut their
doors in your face, in which the play-bills do not flaunt on either side
of the way, and you are not followed through the streets while the
letter-bell is ringing in your ears, with the importunate repetition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>‘A Bill for Covent Garden or Drury Lane,’ is not amiss or out of
reason; and the cry of ‘Hot-cross buns’ fills up the vacancy, and
dallies with the interval of suspense not disagreeably. There is a
large class of persons who only go to the play during Easter: it is hard
if we cannot stay away from it during Passion-week. Our expectations
and satisfaction are enhanced by the short restraint put upon them,
and outward prevarication with our scruples. Without a little spice
of hypocrisy or gravity the world would lose its savour: and by the
periodical mark of reprobation thus set upon it, the play becomes a
sort of pleasant sin all the rest of the year. As for the holiday-folks,
Passion-week is to them a kind of bleak desert, beyond which they
behold the land of promise,—a <em>ha-ha</em>, or line of circumvallation round
the enchanted castle of Pleasure, over which they rush to storm the
citadel with double eagerness and obstreperous glee, escaping from
the formal gloom of Ash-Wednesday and Good-Friday, into the
bright radiance of Easter-Sunday, as from the grave to a bridal, and
‘seizing their pleasures</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We do not think the flutter of hope, the sparkle of joy, in the
young or old adventurers, on these occasions of mirth and licence,
would be complete, were it not for the sense of general restraint and
privation which precedes them, and makes the release from the dead
pause, the involuntary self-denial of the past week, a more precious
achievement to all parties concerned. At least, this inference is
pretty plainly discernible in the smiling looks and uneasy delight of the
truant visitors in the boxes, and the noise and uproar of the overflowing
galleries. To those who object to the disorderly interruptions
of the latter, and consider the being present at an Easter-play as
vulgar on that account, it may be proper to observe that there is no
part of an audience so quiet and attentive as the galleries after the
curtain once draws up, if it is not the fault of the actors or the author,
who do not make themselves heard or understood so far; and again,
we conceive it might be of service to dramatic writers sometimes to
hazard their persons or compromise their dignity in the gallery, to
see what impression their scenes make on hearts fresh from nature’s
mint, instead of stationing themselves in the dress-boxes, to overhear
polite whispers, or moulding their features in the glass of newspaper
criticism the next day. The tears shed in silence by these untutored
spectators, the breath held in, the convulsive sob, the eager gaze, the
glance of delight, would afford better hints and lessons how to revive
the spirit and the pathos of the primitive stage, than any instructions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>derived from drivelling Jerdan or from ranting Croly—nay, than
from our own columns, the only ones, as modest Mr. Blackwood
would say, worthy of the least attention in such matters. As to the
players themselves, we do not know how Passion-week sits upon
them. One would think it would be welcome to them as a break in
the routine of business, as a pause in the wear-and-tear of life: but
there is no saying. For they are so ‘stretched upon the rack of
ecstasy,’ that almost any respite from it may be scarcely endurable.
The public eye, the public voice, becomes a part of a man’s self,
which he can hardly do without, even for an instant. The player
out of his part is like the dram-drinker without his dram, the
snuff-taker without his box. What organ is so sensitive as that of
vanity? What thirst so insatiable, so incessant, as that of praise?
The meagre days of Lent, one would argue previously, would be
‘gaudy-days’ to his Majesty’s servants, the drudges of public
recreation,—snatched from the town, and given to retirement and
oblivion,—brief interval to allay the feverish irritation of popular
applause, to soothe the smart of mortification and disappointment. But
no! the successful candidate thinks every moment lost in which he
is robbed of the need of admiration; the unsuccessful is impatient to
retrieve some error, to convince the public of theirs:—the hopeless
performer thinks it better to be hissed than not noticed at all. Even
the scene-shifters and candle-snuffers (to talk in the old style) fancy
themselves, in a full house and busy night, persons of importance;
and when left to themselves, must feel like fish out of water:—nothing
else but the want of the customary excitement could probably
enable actors to repeat their parts night after night: they stagger
through them like drunken men. Many of the most fortunate seem
uneasy, listless, and dissatisfied, when off the stage, because they do
not see a thousand faces beaming with delight, because they do not
hear at every step the shouts of Gods and men. Why do they not
resort to Bartholomew-fair, where they may act every half-hour
during the day, and not get a wink of sleep at night for the noise of
cymbals and rattles? This is as if a man could never be easy unless
he saw his person reflected in a thousand mirrors, or heard every
word he utters repeated by a hundred echoes. Contempt, poverty,
pain, want, and ‘all the natural ills that flesh is heir to,’ are preferable
to this attainment of all that can be desired, and the craving after more.
The lady in <cite>Love’s Labour Lost</cite> condemns her lover <em>Biron</em>, for his
excess of levity, ‘to jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.’ For ourselves,
we would impose it as a useful penance on those who are
spoiled by the admiration of friends, to take the stage to the <em>Land’s
End</em>, and return by themselves, so as to breathe for a few days out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>the atmosphere of habitual adulation; and as to actors (who are anything
more than <em>walking gentlemen</em>) we think they should be bound
over never to sing a song, or tell a story in private. Their theatrical
pulse is already at a hundred, without shining in company. Those
who have nothing to say but ‘what is set down for them,’ stand the
best chance for repose and moderation, and are also likely to make the
best actors. An actor has not to study his own part, but somebody
else’s, as a painter should not be taken up with himself, but his
sitters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account of the death of the late Mr. Conway, the actor, came
this week—a week of dole. It was melancholy enough, and must
have occasioned regret to some who had at any time commented
freely on his acting. Yet the original cause of it was not his fault,
nor that of the critics—but rather of those who pushed him forward
to run the gauntlet of public opinion, and attract a little momentary
wonder and curiosity, without his being prepared to stand the trial,
or meet the consequences. Popular favourites are too much like the
innocent victims of superstition, led out, garlanded with flowers, to
slaughter and to sacrifice. This was, we think, the case with Mr.
Conway. He was a man of fine personal appearance, of modesty,
and merit; but his more than usual height, and the disproportion
between the shewiness of his figure and his genius for the drama
(though he was by no means devoid of passion or talent) which at
first made crowds of idle people run to look at and applaud him,
afterwards subjected him to unavoidable, though in one sense (and
such he felt it) unjust satire. It cannot be denied that he played
<em>Jaffier</em>, for instance, with considerable force and feeling; and had he
been of the ordinary stature (which is as necessary on the stage as in a
group of statuary) he would have been highly respectable in that and
other parts requiring a certain mixture of tenderness and vehemence.
As it was, those who had at first extolled him to the skies, now
swelled the cry against him; and the honey of adulation was naturally
turned into gall and bitterness. Young, enthusiastic, and sincere, he
attributed to malice and rooted enmity what was owing to accident,
and the caprice and levity of the world, who keep up the sense of
self-importance and excitement, by loading their thoughtless favourite
with caresses one moment, and treating him with every mark of
obloquy the next. Poor Conway was not prepared for this; he
thought their admiration of him lasting and invaluable, their desertion
wounded him to the quick. He did not know that the town was a
hardened jilt, whose fondness or aversion are equally suspicious.
He retired from the conflict, but bore with him the sense of ill-treatment

<p class='c007'>We went on Monday to see young Mr. Kean in <cite>Lovers’ Vows</cite>,
with the intention of expressing an opinion; but we have nothing to
add in the way of criticism to what we have already said. We will
however in so delicate a matter venture on two general remarks for
our own satisfaction, and we should hope for that of others. The
first is, it appears to us clear that Mr. Kean, <em>jun.</em>, will never make
so great an actor as his father; and if not, he had better rest
contented with his father’s fame. The Marquis of Douro does not,
we daresay, think of fighting the battle of Waterloo over again:
why then should the son of Mr. Kean wish to lay up any hard-earned
and doubtful theatrical laurels of his own? The crammed
pit of Covent-Garden is his Mount St. Jean: the third act of <cite>Othello</cite>
should be his escutcheon and his hereditary coat-of-arms. A pettifogging,
cringing lawyer, a leader of a gang of ruffians, is made a
lord, and ennobles a race of ciphers: if this is right, then why
should not a man of genius reflect some of his glory on those next
to him, and leave the dower of his great name to his immediate
posterity? Because the gratitude of the public is insincere, and
nobility a mere state-trick. It is not sentiment, but servility, that
inclines us to pay respect to a long line of nobles or of princes.
Take from the Marquis of Douro his estate of Strathfieldsay, and in
a few years he might be in the King’s Bench, and the <cite>Times</cite> newspaper
would not subscribe five pounds to help him out. If Mr. Kean
had left a hundred thousand pounds behind him, his son might have
sat for a close borough, or have made a ‘vulgar’ Minister of State.
We <em>do</em> think there should be some distinctive mark, some ribbon
of a Legion of Honour, with the smallest possible reversion of
independence, some Tyburn ticket of merit, reserved for the sons
of the Muses and the bastards of fortune, to exempt them alike from
starving and the office of serving the public (which is much the same
thing) for three generations. People talk of birth as necessary to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>honour and to power: did not the popes, the sons of peasants or
of nobody, set their feet upon the necks of monarchs? People talk
of the upstart pretensions of authors and men of intellect in modern
times: did not the priest (the learned men of their day) come in as
the first estate between heaven and the nobles? Why then taunt
the flame of genius with being earth-born? It is the dotage of a
prejudice to do so. We repeat, the sons of celebrated men are
hardly off: the example of their parents (together with necessity)
urges them to do something: that very example, from being too near,
and almost seeming to save them the trouble of exertion, precludes
the possibility of success. Even where the genius might be the same,
the imitation and also the habitual idea of doing something extraordinary
without knowing what, is prejudicial, if not fatal; and if
they wish to turn out anything, they should strike into a path the
opposite of what is always before them. Young Kean perhaps
would shine as a University-wrangler, or a conveyancer under the bar;
and the son of a philosopher should go to court! Again, Mr. Kean is
said by his friends to be a promising young actor. We have nothing to
say to that; but we will tell him one thing, there is no such person as a
promising actor. It is here, as in all similar pursuits, performance or
nothing. We do not say no great actor improves, but no actor becomes
great by improvement. The sun is seen as soon as it appears above
the horizon: there is the same glory round its rising and its setting:
so may it always be with the sun of genius, which is the lamp of the
world! Garrick fell as it were from the clouds: Mr. Kean’s
father rose at once from obscurity. The late Mr. Kemble was the
only actor that we remember to have attained to the first rank by
gradual advances; and he was sustained in his progress by great
stateliness of manner and advantages of person. In general, those
who are always improving on themselves, are surpassed by others,
and complain that, as they are about to seize the wreath of fame,
it is snatched from them by some bolder and more fortunate
hand. We do not presume to sit on Mr. Kean’s <i><span lang="la">quantum meruit</span></i>—we
will not—but if he is not likely to become a first-rate actor,
his name forbids him to be aught less. If he knows our tone in
speaking when we are serious or merely splenetic, he will know that
these remarks are dictated by anything but a feeling hostile to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>A new melo-dramatic entertainment succeeded, called <cite>The Dumb
Savoyard and his Monkey</cite>. The story is in few words, as follows:
The <em>Count Maldecini</em> having been condemned to die (we know not
why—for these inventions plunge us at once <em>in medias res</em>) his wife
accompanied by their little child appears suddenly on the stage with
a pardon for him. The ferryman at Ober Wesel, however, refuses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>to carry her up the river, as the hour is too late; and she is in
despair, when the Savoyard, with the assistance of his monkey,
undertakes to convey her to the place of destination. They arrive
safely at the Falls of the Grenfells, near the salt-mine, in which her
husband is confined, when they are attacked by a band of robbers
who take a number of valuable ornaments from her, and among the
rest the morocco-case, containing her husband’s pardon; but this, at
her passionate and distracted entreaty, the chief restores in a fit of
generosity, and with an appropriate speech for a German robber.
Meantime, the monkey contrives to pick the pardon out of the case,
and hide it in a crevice of the rock, on the top of which he sits
grinning, the demon of mischief and meddlesomeness. When the
<em>Countess</em> arrives at the prison, she accordingly misses what she had
built all her hopes upon, but she deceives the jailor and escapes with
her husband, also by the aid of the Savoyard and the dextrous
<em>Marmozette</em>. They are pursued and overtaken just at the very spot
where the precious document had been lost; and as the Count is
about to be shot, in conformity to his sentence, which he reads and
very sentimentally and loyally approves, the monkey betrays the
hiding-place of the pardon, which the frantic <em>Countess</em> eagerly rescues
from his grasp, and the whole ends happily. Mrs. W. West played
the heroine, and looked forlorn and interesting. Mrs. Barrymore
was <em>Pipino</em>, the Dumb Savoyard, and made a very pretty boy. As
to the nimble <em>Marmozette</em> (Master Wieland), if it depended on us,
we would make him skip. Our old acquaintance <em>Jocko</em> has left a
numerous progeny behind him, and we are afraid we shall never see
the end of the breed. Why, in the midst of the beautiful and
enchanting scenery on the banks of the Rhine (so admirably represented
in this piece) must we have an artificial monster staring us in
the face like an ugly looking-glass the whole time. We have no
patience on this point. We never could bear to see that branch of
the species on or off the stage, and would shoot them like the man in
Candide, even at a risk of similar consequences. We have no need
of a menagerie in a play-house; the money taken at the door on such
occasions should be a deodand to the proprietors of Exeter-’Change.
We wish the <cite>Times</cite>, in its gravity, would take up the subject, and
with its leaden mace drive these <i><span lang="la">lusus naturæ</span></i> and nauseous <em>double-entendres</em>
from the scene.—We did not recover our equanimity till
Miss Foote, as <em>Meggy Macgilpin</em>, and her pretty Highland dress, put
us into good humour; and O’Keefe’s song of <cite>Twang twang darillo</cite>,
between Gatty and Russell, scattered every particle of bile in a roar
of laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The holiday attraction of the week has been a melodrama called
<cite>Tuckitomba</cite>, said to be founded on a fact which happened in Jamaica
fifty years ago. The interest turns on a black sorceress who steals
her master’s child out of revenge, on an old pirate (<em>Tuckitomba</em>) who
runs away with a mulatto-girl for love, and on the blowing up of the
vessel in which they set sail for Africa, by the carelessness of a tailor
on board (Blanchard) who sets fire to the powder-magazine with the
contents of his tobacco-pipe. There was a great deal of bustle, and
a want of interest in this piece. The prominent trait was the acting
of Keeley, who is called ‘for shortness’ Goliah. This gentleman
really answers to <em>Falstaff’s</em> description of ‘a man made after supper
of a cheese-paring.’ He is a shred of comedy; a pocket-Liston.
He is great in little parts, and makes an amusing approach to a
nonentity.—The Minor Theatres have each had their novelties during
the week, and been tolerably successful. The critics are divided on
the temper and behaviour of John Bull at this season. Some say he
was lumpish and leaden at Drury-Lane on Monday, others, that he
was in all his glory at Covent-Garden on the same evening. It is
from seeing the confusion and uncertainty that prevail in the most
authentic reports that we propose shortly to publish two <cite>Examiners</cite> a
week, to set the town right in these and such-like particulars, and to
save them the trouble of consulting the daily papers altogether. As
to John’s behaviour, pleased or sulky, drunk or sober, we never
could see any difference in it. Where we were, a man stood up on
a bench in the pit, and another insisting on his getting down, and on
his refusal threatening to call him out the next day, the first made
answer—‘Aye, if your master will let you!’—‘Master! what do
you mean by that? I have no master: I come and go where I
please!’ The women now interfered, and one of them clapped her
handkerchief to her husband’s mouth to prevent further disagreeables.
All an Englishman’s ideas are modifications of his will; and it is
strange that with all his boasted independence and equality, he thinks
he has a right to insult every one who is not a better man than himself.
The reason is, he has no respect for himself, nor consequently
for others, except for some external advantage of wealth or situation;
and his ill-humour can only be bribed to keep the peace by his self-interest.
‘Vice to be hated needs but to be seen:‘—we are sure
that this at least may be said of ill-manners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turn we from them to the French play, where the object is to
enjoy the scene, to be pleased with yourself, and not to insult your
neighbours, or inquire which is master and which is man. There
have been several <i><span lang="fr">debûts</span></i>, all very creditable and successful, Monsieur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Berteche, Madame Beaufre, and Mademoiselle Irma. We saw the
former (who is of the Mademoiselle Mars school, and whose tongue
runs faster than a race-horse) in the <i><span lang="la">Ecole des Veillards</span></i> with Monsieur
Perlet, who plays the jealous husband with great point and spirit:
but shall we add, that in the passionate parts, he does not <em>let out</em>
enough, there is an interdicted and internal manner, a fidgetty and
confined air, which is probably owing to the subordinate parts in
which he usually acts. In this comedy, a gentleman pulls off his
coat on the stage, which is with us an indecorum, except in farce.
We mention this to show the difference of feeling in such matters.
We missed Perlet in the <cite>Cheats of Scapin</cite>: he always contrives to
<em>cheat</em> us of our favourite Moliere. But we had a full taste of him in
the <i><span lang="fr">Anglaises pour rire</span></i>. And these are our fair country-women—so
they sit, speak, walk, sing, and dance, in the eyes of foreigners!
No, it is Monsieur Pelissie and Monsieur Perlet—but very like!</p>

<p class='c007'>The last week or two has been rich in theatricals; Miss Stephens in
<cite>Love in a Village</cite>, where the scene opens with those two young
beauties sitting in a bower of roses like a flower stuck in the stomacher
of beauty, and where that unconscious siren ‘warbles her native
wood-notes wild’ with such simplicity and sweetness; Charles
Kemble in the <cite>Inconstant</cite>, who in one glorious scene plays tragedy and
comedy to the life, and in one short moment tastes the ‘fierce
extremes’ of pleasure and agony, of life and death; and <cite>Othello</cite>, with
bumpers and three times three; to say nothing of Madame Vestris
in the <cite>Invincibles</cite>, and Mr. John Reeve in the immortal <cite>Major
Sturgeon</cite>. Why then did we take no notice of them? Notice we
have taken, but it has been with ‘our mind’s eye,’ in ‘our heart’s
core.’ Ill will it fare with us, when we do not cast a sidelong glance
at those pregnant abridgments, the play-bills, and when their flaunting
contents, that unfold to us the map of our life, no longer excite a
smile or a sigh. Any one who pleases may then write our epitaph,
though it will not be worth writing. At such a season, for instance,
we saw Mrs. Siddons in such a part for the first time; in such another,
Kemble walked with regal air across the stage, and his stately brow
needed no diadem to set it off; in such a character Bannister was in
all his glory; in that, Suett vented his resistless folly; here, Munden
went the whole length of his face; here, Lewis was all life and air;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>here, Jack Palmer was great indeed; here, King was bitter in <cite>Touchstone</cite>,
and Miss Pope romantic in <cite>Audrey</cite>; then, Mrs. Goodall played
the part of <em>Rosalind</em>, and tripped in becoming page’s attire through
the forest of Ardennes (days and years long past!); here, Dignum
warbled as <em>Amiens</em> (before we had heard of the peace of Amiens);
and here, Mrs. Jordan’s laugh comes over the heart, and if it has
grown dry and seared, fills it with the remembrance of joy and
gladness once more. Dodd and Parsons hover in the extreme verge
of the horizon, but gay shadows, airy shapes. Then such a one took
leave of the stage, drawing a narrower circle within the natural circle
of his being; then Liston appeared in the <cite>Finger-Post</cite>, looking like a
finger-post, with his nose only pointing to fun; Elliston in <cite>Wild Oats</cite>
(will he never sow ’em?); Matthews in the <cite>Bee-Hive</cite>, as busy as a
bee; Miss Kelly in chambermaids; Miss O’Neill in heroines; last,
not least, Mr. Kean, the ‘bony prizer’ of the stage, who has knocked
all other reputations and his own on the head. What a host of
names and recollections is here! How many more are omitted,
names that have embodied famous poets’ verse and been the ‘fancy’s
midwife,’ that have gladdened a nation and made life worth living for,
that have made the world pass in review as a gaudy pageant, and set
before us in a waking dream the bodily shapes and circumstances of
all that is most precious in joy or in sorrow! And is it come to this,
that the drama is accounted vulgar by the vulgar, and that we are to
cut our old acquaintances the players, those who have thrown a light
upon the morning, noon, and evening of our day, ‘gay creatures of
the element, that live ‘i th’ rainbow and play in the plighted clouds,’
and who have taken us so many hundred times to sit and laugh with
them, or shed ‘tears such as angels weep,’ at a height where we could
look down at the sordid of the earth—and at a universe of Operas,
with their naked <em>figurantes</em>, and sense and soul muffled up in sound to
suit the callous taste or ranker gust of ears polite! We may have
said all this before; and here lies the misfortune of our office. A
theatrical audience is supposed to vary every night: the <em>reading public</em>
is assumed to be always the same body. We could praise Mr.
Charles Kemble’s acting in <cite>Young Mirabel</cite> every time he does it, and
are always glad to think he is going to play what does such credit to
his art and gives such pleasure to others; but we can say nothing
about it, having once expressed our opinion to that effect. An actor
repeats a favourite part till farther notice; a singer may be <em>encored</em>
in an air as often as his friends please; thank God, we have stockpieces
that never wear out: but who ever ventured upon reviving a
defunct criticism? It might pass with the million, but some good-natured
friend would betray us. The writer’s secret would be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>out, and he would be had up as an imposter. Nevertheless, having
meditated a new criticism (or eulogy, for it is the same thing)
on Mr. Kean’s <cite>Othello</cite>, and the overflowing house having excluded us
from the Free-List, we venture upon borrowing an old one; and if
we were to try, we do not know that we could <em>mend our draught</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Mr. Kean’s <cite>Othello</cite> is, we suppose, the finest piece of acting in the
world. It is impossible either to describe or praise it adequately.
We have never seen any actor so wrought upon—so “perplexed in
the extreme.” The energy of passion, as it expresses itself in action,
is not the most terrific part: it is the agony of his soul, shewing itself
in looks and tones of voice. In one part, where he listens in dumb
despair to the fiend-like insinuations of <em>Iago</em>, he presented the very
face, the marble aspect of Dante’s <cite>Count Ugolino</cite>. On his fixed eyelids
“horror sat plumed.” In another part, where a gleam of hope or
of tenderness returns to subdue the tumult of his passions, his voice
broke in faultering accents from his overcharged breast. His lips
might be said less to utter words than to distil drops of blood gushing
from his heart. An instance of this was in his pronunciation of the
line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of one that loved not wisely, but too well.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The whole of this last speech was indeed given with exquisite force
and beauty. We only object to the virulence with which he delivers
the last line, and with which he stabs himself—a virulence which
<cite>Othello</cite> would neither feel against himself at the moment, nor against
the “turbaned Turk” (whom he had slain) at such a distance of
time. His exclamation on seeing his wife, “I cannot think but
<em>Desdemona’s</em> honest,” was the “glorious triumph of exceeding love,”
a thought flashing conviction on his mind, and irradiating his countenance
with joy, like sudden sunshine. In fact almost every scene or
sentence in this extraordinary exhibition is a master-piece of natural
passion. The convulsed motion of the hands, and the involuntary
swelling of the veins in the forehead, in some of the most painful
situations, should not only suggest topics of critical panegyric, but
might furnish studies to the painter or sculptor.’</p>

<p class='c007'>After <cite>Othello</cite> on Wednesday, <cite>The Mayor of Garratt</cite> followed
‘with kindliest change.’ Mr. Reeve played <em>Major Sturgeon</em>, and
Mr. Keeley, <em>Jerry Sneak</em>. Comparisons are odious: <em>therefore</em> they
are made. Mr. Keeley’s <em>Jerry</em> was not so good as Russell’s formerly;
nor Mr. Reeve’s <em>Major Sturgeon</em> equal to Dowton’s. This is saying
nothing, for both those performances were of the very first water.
Mr. Keeley’s person is diminutive, and he seems the natural butt of
a virago: Russell was a goodly man of his inches; it was his spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>only that was hen-pecked, and that submitted to buffets and blows.
Dowton again was the model of a train-band Captain in his own
esteem, and never doubted of the ineffable superiority of his own
pretensions: Reeve, in the midst of his insolence and vapouring, has a
look of <em>quizzing</em> himself, and sees through the ridicule of his own
character. He however throws much humour and fantastic absurdity
into the part, <em>à-la-Liston</em>; but his drollery is conscious and knowing,
not vacant and absolutely spontaneous, like that of his unrivalled
prototype. At the end of the farce, there was some division of
opinion whether the piece was not low, as if that which had mainly
driven such manners and characters almost from the knowledge of the
present generation was not a master-stroke of genius, and in fact an
historical drama.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been a new farce here (called, disagreeably enough, <cite>The
Little Offsprings</cite>). If Mr. Peake is one of the most amusing of our
farce writers, it is because he pretends to be nothing better. He
professes to write a <em>farce</em>, not a <em>genteel</em> comedy; and he generally
succeeds accordingly. Our complaint against his present novelty is,
that unlike most of his previous ones, it is not quite <em>broad</em> enough.
He himself will smile at this objection, because assuredly it is quite
broad enough where it <em>is</em> broad. But it is not ‘as <em>broad</em> as it is <em>long</em>,’
which is what all farces ought to be. Young ladies as well bred as
they are well dressed, and young gentlemen ‘to match,’ are interlopers
in the region of farce. Let Mr. Peake eschew all such amiable
insipidities, and he will do well. In short, let him cultivate the
<em>gentilities</em> of life not a step farther than they fall in with the case
(anything but genteel) of Mr. Wrench; and then he cannot go very
far wrong. Above all, let him have nothing to say to young ladies
who are a whit more like <em>Lady Teazle</em> than Miss Kelly is. They are
ticklish handling in all cases; and in his there is no answering for the
mischief they may do.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>It includes a fox-hunting Admiral, played, or rather worked, with
great effect by Bartley;—a bluff and blundering boatswain, which
Fawcett acted to the life, that is to say, somewhat disagreeably;—a
person wearing a white hat and pea-green pantaloons, things always
enough to make the sight of Mr. Wrench pleasant; a suppositious
spinster (Mrs. Davenport), who turns out to be the parent of one of
the ‘little offsprings,’ her brother the Admiral being similarly situated
as to the other;—and finally, the ‘offsprings’ themselves, played (as
aforesaid) by Miss Goward and Mr. Keeley, and about whom there
is a good deal of ingenious equivoque which touches upon the extreme
edge where such matters are, now-a-days, so apt to fall over. They
pretty nearly did so on the above occasion, which has, no doubt,
induced Mr. Peake to make the proper sacrifices to the suspicious
delicacy of ‘some people’s ears.’</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Don Giovanni</cite> was played at this theatre on Thursday for the
benefit of Madame Caradori, in which Mademoiselle Sontag sustained
the part of <em>Donna Anna</em> with great truth and effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>We said something lately on the company at the holiday theatres:
we have something to say on the company at the Opera. We
have little hesitation in stating (we speak of the pit) that in its way
it is quite as bad: from boisterous rudeness and familiarity it rises
into distance and superciliousness. If for instance at the Surrey
or the Coburg you see two fellows quarrelling which is the master
and which is the man, at the King’s Theatre you hear an elegant
discourse on ‘the higher and the lower orders.’ A critic at Covent-Garden
or Drury-Lane thinks Sadler’s Wells or the East London
<em>low</em>: a critic of the self-same stamp, but one of softer phrase, pronounces
the condemnation of the drama in good set terms as altogether
exploded in the fashionable circles, and as flourishing most in our
manufacturing towns and the semi-barbarous states of North America.
You hear another take up the lamentable theme of an interval in the
succession of regular Opera-singers, as if it were a pause in nature;
and when notwithstanding he has heard Braham sing very well in
‘<em>this house</em>,’ repeating the words as if the atmosphere at the Haymarket
wafted other sounds than common air, and music were a
geographical distinction. Thus it is that an Englishman is always
pinning his faith on places and persons; and that he cannot arrive
(for the soul of him, let him be taught and trammelled how he will)
at the contemplation of an abstract idea: and yet the booby talks of
refinement. He has no conception of anything but from the situation
where he finds it; or the figure it makes in the eyes of some one as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>wise as himself; or from its being a foil to some defect in others.
You hear none of this gabble at the <i><span lang="fr">Thêatre Français</span></i>, or the Italian
Opera in Paris, about those exploded authors Racine and Molière, or
the low buffoonery of the <i><span lang="fr">Theatre des Varietés</span></i>, because they understand
or relish both: we, unfortunately, who understand and relish
neither, are obliged to create an artificial admiration of what is exotic
out of our contempt for what is native, and pamper our pretensions to
refinement by constantly dwelling on the vulgarity of the lower orders.
Delightful it is to hear the Frenchwomen speaking of ‘the vulgar
Englishwomen’ in a lump, as these same Englishwomen speak of all
the rest of their country-women! In France, to laugh and weep (at
least with the comic or the tragic Muse) is not held vulgar. All wit
is not confined to a shake of the toe, nor all sense to the squall of an
Opera-singer, though they dance and give concerts as well as we.
But in England our object is not the pursuit of pleasure, but to run
away from the pleasures of others; and when a taste for the drama or
anything else becomes a little common, we grow sulky and insensible
by way of being spiritual and refined. We see no other refinement
in the case, unless the getting rid of thought and feeling is a proof of
refinement; and the <em>figurantes</em> at the Opera are an intermediate link, a
soft imperceptible gradation, between the grossness of human passion
and the absence of all human sympathy. Do the upper classes speak
in recitative? Do they, in answer to a common question, vault into
the air? Perhaps a Noble Duke might make one of his speeches
intelligible by singing it, or solve the difficulties of the Corn question
by calling out the Lord Chancellor to dance a minuet with him!
We import Opera-singers, dancers, kings! Liberal land! That
knows its own deficiencies in what is refined and elevated! Happy,
that it finds others so ready to oblige it! All that they get from us,
is hard blows or hard cash: all that we get from them, is politeness
and luxury! In a word the question comes to this—<cite>Are the English
an essentially vulgar people or not?</cite> If all that they have of their own
is vulgar and unworthy of the notice of the upper classes, then the
unavoidable inference is that the upper classes themselves are unworthy
to see anything better, and are the most vulgar, fashionable audience
in Europe. If we have the least possible capacity for the fine arts,
namely, dancing, music, painting, then we must be, in spite of letters-patent
of nobility, or a box at the opera, or a <em>chapeau-bras</em>, or an
opera-glass, the worst possible judges of them; and if we would be
anything at all, must set up for something else. Indeed, the effects
are plain enough. There is that little Brocard; she was at one time
a model of voluptuous, languishing grace; but it was thrown away
upon the higher orders, and she now does nothing but walk on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>tips of her toes. The little trifler, she that we have praised so often!
We are after all in such matters a Bartlemy-fair audience—or for a
tumbler’s show! Is Madame Pasta a favourite with the great vulgar?
Not in the least. They hear her fame, but not her. What piteous,
vacant aspects in the fine gentleman in the pit the first night of
Mademoiselle Sontag’s appearance! And what would they not have
given (before committing themselves beyond an applause which might
be construed into a good-natured encouragement) to know what the
newspapers would say the next day! What then is the amount of
this exclusive preference and fastidious superiority of fashionable taste?
Mere arrogance and affectation. Look at the men in the pit. Are
they in raptures with the ballet or the music? They are solely
occupied in thinking how they themselves look, whether their coat is
of the right cut, their cravat properly tied, and whether their next
neighbour is good enough for them to speak to. Each opera-beau
ought to have a glass-case over him to keep him within a certain
precise sphere of <em>dandy</em> repulsiveness and self-importance. In an
O. P. row you are in danger of being knocked down: in the <em>still-life</em>
of the Opera-house, every one seems in fear of touching his neighbour’s
elbow. The disagreeable either in thought or action is inseparable
from our fogs and sea-coal fires. Look at the women in the boxes.
Are they at their ease? Or do they not keep one fixed attitude, or
else loll, and laugh, and stare without meaning? The great thing is
not to seem to take an interest; and this is not difficult, where none
is felt. If to paint, to dress, to intrigue, and be insensible, is the
height of refinement, then the women in the lobbies are even more
refined than they. Do we then subscribe to this total disqualification
of the English character? No: we have hearts and heads for other
things besides the mechanism of the senses. We have books, which
we send through the heart of all Europe; but our people of fashion
and our parade of gentility are the laughing-stock of the world. One
service which the work on <cite>Lord Byron and his Contemporaries</cite> has
done the public, one offence it has given to the insolent few, is that it
shews that even the strongest minds are not exempt from the shallowness
and pedantry of this kind of jargon. The Noble Poet somewhere
says that he and Tom Moore wrote well, because he himself from
birth, and Mr. Moore from circumstances (circumstances indeed!)
moved in the fashionable world. If this were all, we should have
some thousands of fine geniuses come out every year, ‘the mob of
gentlemen who write with ease!’ Why, instead of opening the
casket to examine the contents, are we to be always looking at the
outside? Or why, having found a jewel in it, persist that the wrapper
was coarse brown paper? When we hear all the inhabitants of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>great country whose names are not inscribed in the Red Book, or who
are not crammed into the stifling, glittering atmosphere of the King’s
Theatre, stigmatised with the sweeping epithet of ‘the lower orders,’
our patience is a little out at elbows, and the answer, we fear, will not
come from the pen alone! What is it that my Lord-Duke brings
with him from the Continent—that he shews to his fellow-travellers
as a precious curiosity—that he folds up and unfolds with such care?
Is it a cameo, a drawing by Raphael, a bit of Claude? It is a copy
of the Great Tun of Heidelberg! When did the polite world think
it allowable for the last time to throng to the English theatre in
crowds and with their expectations excited to the utmost? To see
young Mr. Kean, a boy just come from Eton (classical reminiscence!)
in the part of <em>Norval</em>! Or to see the bottle-conjuror, or a
thing born with a crown on its head, or any other rare and striking
novelty! Spare us, man of fashion, in the name of refinement!</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>On Tuesday, the <cite>Beggars’ Opera</cite> was acted here; or rather, half
the <cite>Beggars’ Opera</cite> to half a house. This is as it should be: if the
Managers start and shrug up their shoulders at one half of a play,
the public will shrink from the other. It is always wrong to cry
<em>stale fish</em>. We suspect some clerical critic, some <em>Jeremy Collier</em> of
the <cite>Times</cite>, has had a hand in this: what have these reverend divines
to do with profane stage-plays, any more than poets and novelists
with writing <em>lay-sermons</em>? Everything in our day is turned topsy-turvy:
nothing prevails but ‘vanity, chaotic vanity.’ The consequence
of this sort of slur and neglect thrown upon the piece is, that
it is indifferently acted. There is not, in the expressive green-room
phrase, ‘a hand in the house’: and without that, the performer has
no heart to proceed. A player can no more act with spirit unless he
sees the reflection of his excellences in the looks and satisfaction of
the audience, than a fine lady can dress without a looking-glass. He
makes a hit and it fails of effect; he is therefore thrown out, and the
next time he does wrong or he does nothing. <em>Filch</em> (Meadows)
picks a pocket as if he was afraid of being detected by the pit: Miss
Kelly is shocked at the part of <em>Lucy</em>, and flounces and elbows through
it as if she wished to get out of it, putting a negative on an <em>encore</em> that
is likely to detain her five minutes longer in Newgate: Miss Stephens
(the charming <em>Polly</em>) is frightened at the interest she <em>might</em> inspire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>and is loth to ‘waste her sweetness on a <em>blackguard</em> air’: the <em>Captain</em>
(Mr. Wood) is the only person who stands fire on the trying
occasion. This gentleman is the best <em>Macheath</em> we have seen for a
long time (for in criticism as in law we must have our statute of
limitations)—more of a gentleman than Incledon, a better singer
than Davies, less affected than Young, less finical than Sinclair, as
‘pretty a fellow’ as Madame Vestris—good-looking, gallant, debonair,
and vocal. Bartley is too ‘splenetic and rash’ for <em>Lockitt</em>, who
should be sullen and hardened as his prison-walls; Blanchard is not
round and set enough for <em>Peachum</em>, his figure dangling and his voice
crackling like a lawyer’s parchment; Mrs. Davenport alone remained
in her original muslin apron, silk gown, and pinners (a Sybil, yet
how unlike a prophetess!) to overlook and wonder at the desolation
of the classic scene. We are more and more convinced that there is
a time for everything, and that good plays must give place to bad
ones. It is not possible (with a mixed audience) to keep alive the
ridicule of manners after the manners themselves have ceased, nor to
preserve them in the spirit of wit, or exhibit them even in mock-heroics.
The stage is but the counterpart of existing follies—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And when the date of Nock was out,</div>
      <div class='line'>Off fell the sympathetic snout.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>However, the <cite>Beggars’ Opera</cite> has run a century. That’s pretty
well. Oh George Colman the Younger, Messrs. Reynolds and
Morton, how will you rejoice, could you lift up your heads a hundred
years hence, and see a five-act play of yours cut down to a one-act
farce! It is not that there are not plenty of rogues and pick pockets
at present; but the Muse is averse to look that way; the imagination
has taken a higher flight; wit and humour do not flow in that dirty
channel, picking the grains of gold out of it. Instead of descending,
we aspire; and the age has a sublime front given to it to contemplate
the heaven of drawing-rooms and the milky-way of fashion. You
are asked if you like Fielding, as if it were a statuteable offence; and
it was justly observed the other day in a comparison between <em>De Vere</em>
and <em>Count Fathom</em>, that in a refined period like ours, a rogue aims at
nothing short of being Prime-Minister! In a word, the French
Revolution has spoiled all, like a great stone thrown into a well ‘with
hollow and rueful rumble,’ and left no two ideas in the public mind
but those of high and low. The jealousy of gentility, the horror of
being thought vulgar, has put an end to the harmless <em>double-entendre</em>
of wit and humour; and the glancing lights and shades of life
(nothing without each other) are sunk into the dull night of insipidity
and affectation. So be it, and so it will be! Yet ‘we have heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>the chimes at midnight’ for all this, and passed over Hounslow and
Bagshot, not without a <em>twinge</em> of the recollection of other times, as
well as responsive to the names of Pope, of Gay, and Queensberry’s
Duchess! Nor is it so long since we have seen good company and
full houses grace the representation of Tyburn tree: we remember
old Sir John Sylvester among others (with we believe his two
daughters) who had a keen relish for an execution, and stedfastly
contemplated under black bushy eyebrows that irrefragable order of
ideas (as Mr. Hobbes calls it) ‘the thief, the judge, and the
gallows;’ and Mr. Vansittart, who smiled with conscious simplicity
at the satirical allusions to Ministers of State, might be supposed to
be comparing the terseness and point of Gay’s style with his own
‘wolds and sholds,’ and seemed to think that nothing but an
<em>evangelical</em> housebreaker was wanting to the perfection of the plot!—We
could not stay out <cite>A Race for Dinner</cite>, though invited by
Mr. Wrench,—who has become as hungry as a hunter of late,—but
made the best of our way to the other house (old Drury) in search
of a criticism. We could almost fancy Covent Garden had got
there before us, for there we found nearly the whole former strength
of the rival house drawn up in battle-array before us—‘and Birnamwood
was come to Dunsinane’—through what bickerings, what
strifes, what heart-burnings, what jealousies between actors, what
quarrels with managers, what want of pay, and demands for more,
is easy (though not pleasant) to guess. They had also brought the
<cite>Poor Gentleman</cite> with them; and both together brought a full house.
Nothing could be better acted. Looking at them with ‘eyes of
youth’ (which we always take with us to the theatre) we seemed
as it were to witness something like a <em>turn-out</em> of Chelsea pensioners
on the boards; and the sentiments of the play were of a piece with
this patriotic and charitable impression. About thirty years ago,
when John Bull took a particular fit of hatred against the French,
he also fell in love with himself; and the dramatic writers of that
day undertook to shew John his own face, his virtues or vices ‘to
advantage dressed’ in a succession of plays which were properly
<em>Dedications to the English nation</em>. We have the <cite>Whole Duty of Man</cite>
bound up in a coarse, unattractive exterior; the Virtues in the front
of the stage, though the Graces stand a little in the back-ground;
and all the charities of private life clustering together on the stage,
as they do round the domestic hearth. We have nothing but
generous uncles, dry in their manner, but their heart and their purse
overflowing with liberality—dutiful nephews, thoughtless but well-meaning,
and falling into scrapes and love at every turn—reclaimed
seducers—exemplary young ladies—old servants surly, but honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>(the English character)—a chattering apothecary, the butt of the
village and a foil to our self-love—an old soldier, a favourite in the
family, and with us, for he has been wounded in our defence—a poor
gentleman, in want of money which he refuses by mistake from some
munificent patron, in consequence of not being so shrewd as the
audience, and who is in hourly danger of a prison, from which <em>we</em>
hope to escape. All this hits our delicate and improved moral tastes
much better than sneering at our vices or laughing at our follies.
Live sentiment, perish satire! Then there is so much distress,
which it is so delightful to sympathize with—so much money
circulating to relieve it (which it is so delightful to hear and to
see; it is almost like attending a charity-sermon, or seeing Mr. Irving
himself pawn his watch out of an excess of missionary zeal)—then
there are so many tears starting into the eye, so many squeezes of the
hand, so many friends and relations falling into one another’s arms,
as cannot but move the most obdurate—so many bailiffs in the wind,
so many duels broken off by the entrance of some antiquated spinster
who is always prying into mischief, or of some charming young
creature who is the cause of it. We hope the other actors and
actresses who acquitted themselves so admirably in their several
parts,—Mr. Dowton in <cite>Sir R. Bramble</cite>, Mr. Mathews in <cite>Ollapod</cite>,
Mr. Liston in <cite>Corporal Foss</cite>, Mr. Cooper in <cite>Lieutenant Worthington</cite>,
Mr. Jones in <cite>Frederic</cite>, Mrs. Davison in <cite>Miss Mactab</cite>,—will excuse
us if we pass them over on this occasion to pay our compliments to
Miss Ellen Tree, who played <em>Emily Worthington</em>, and who certainly
comes under the description of persons last-mentioned. Without
any appearance of art, she played so well that she seemed the
character itself, with the ease and simplicity of an innocent school-girl.
Her figure is very pleasing—her voice is like her sister’s—and
she has the handsomest mouth in the world. We will not attempt
to describe it for two reasons: first, because we cannot; secondly,
because we <em>dare</em> not. In Mr. Jones’s <cite>School for Gallantry</cite> she might
have been called the <i><span lang="fr">bon bouche</span></i>. Amidst the chopping and changing
of the theatres, we had forgotten Mr. Jones was at Drury Lane;
and inquired after the success of his new piece at Covent Garden.
We naturally enough received an answer almost as cold as the moon
which shines through the bars of his hero’s prison-chamber. We
were glad however to find that the wit and pleasantry diffused over
it, if faint, had much of the agreeable lustre of that mild planet.
We should suppose the plot borrowed from the country where the
scene is laid. Cupid seems always on garrison-duty in the Prussian
monarchy, and the spirit of adventure and gallantry somewhat
languishes and grows trifling when it is kept (as everything there is)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>under lock and key. After what we have said of Miss E. Tree, we
will not forfeit our reputation for gallantry by saying anything less
obliging of Miss Love, who plays a young hussar officer in this piece,
than that we like her best when she is drest most like herself.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite> was revived here on Wednesday, with the
original words and additional songs. We however missed <em>Christopher
Sly</em>, that supreme dramatic critic, who should have sat in lordly
judgment on the piece, and given a drunken relief to it. This
representing of a play within a play (of which Shakspeare was fond)
produces an agreeable theatrical perspective—it is like painting a
picture in a picture—and intimates pointedly enough that all are but
shadows, the pageants of a dream. We also missed Mr. Liston in
this part; for we understand he has some good quips and crotchets
about it. Unless we saw him, we cannot pretend to say how he
would do it; for we consider Mr. Liston in the light of an author
rather than of an actor, and he makes his best parts out of his own
head or face, in a sort of <em>brown study</em>, with very little reference to
the text. He has nevertheless more comic humour oozing out of
his features and person than any other actor in our remembrance, or
than we have any positive evidence of since the time of Hogarth.
No one is <em>stultified</em>, no one is <em>mystified</em> like him—no one is so deep in
absurdity, no one so full of vacancy; no one puzzles so over a doubt,
or goes the whole length of an extravagance like him—no one
chuckles so over his own conceit, or is so dismayed at finding his
mistake:—the genius of folly spreads its shining gloss over his face,
tickles his nose, laughs in his eyes, makes his teeth chatter in his
head, or draws up every muscle into a look of indescribable dulness,
or freezes his whole person into a lump of ice (as in <cite>Lubin Log</cite>) or
relaxes it into the very thaw and dissolution of all common sense
(as in his <em>Lord Grizzle</em>). Munden’s acting (which many prefer,
and in this number may be included Mr. Liston himself) was
external, overdone, and aimed at the galleries—it was a sort of
prodigious and inspired <em>face-making</em>—Liston’s humour bubbles up of
itself, and runs over from the mere fulness of the conception. If he
does not go out of himself, he looks into himself, and ruminates on
the idea of the idle, the quaint, and the absurd, till it does his heart
good within him, and makes ‘the lungs of others crow like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>chanticleer.’ Munden’s expressions, if they could have been taken
off on the spot, would have made a capital set of grotesque masks:
Liston’s would make a succession of original comic sketches, as rich
as they are true:—Mr. Wilkie failed in attempting one of them—his
pencil was not oily and unctuous enough. We have seen many
better comedians, that is, better imitators of existing or supposed
characters and manners—such as Emery, Little Simmons, Dowton,
and others—we know no other actor who has such a fund of drollery
in himself, or that makes one laugh in the same hearty unrestrained
manner, free from all care or controul, that we do with <em>Sancho Panza</em>
or <em>Parson Adams</em>. We have heard a story of Mr. Liston being
prevented by some accident from attending his professional duties,
and wrapping himself up in a flannel gown and heart’s-content over
a winter fire, to read our good old English novelists for a fortnight
together. What fine marginal notes his face would make! Which
would he enjoy most, the blanket falling and discovering philosopher
<em>Square</em> behind it, or the drawing up of the curtain and the broad
laugh of the pit? We will answer that question for him. The
meanest apprentice that sees a play for the first time from the
gallery, has more pleasure than the most admired actor that ever
trod the stage: there is more satisfaction in reading one page of a
sterling author with good faith and good will, than the writer had
in the composition or even the success of all his works put together.
The admiration we bestow on others comes from the heart; but
never returns back to it. Vanity closes up the avenues, or envy
poisons it. This digression is too long: without sometimes going
out of our way, we should hardly get to the end of our task.—The
revival, on the whole, went off pleasantly, though the acting was not
remarkably good, nor the music by any means enlivening. Jaques’s
recommendation to Amiens—‘Warble, warble,’—seems to be the
device of most modern composers, who think that, if they string a
set of unmeaning notes together, it must be heavenly harmony.
’Tis pitiful. We are sick to death of this interpolated <em>sing-song</em>;
nor do we think it much mended by proceeding from the mouth of
Mr. Braham, who is in such cases a piece of operatic fleecy hosiery.
He is a walking woolsack:—‘And when the bag was opened, the
voice began to sing,’ &#38;c. We may be wrong in this matter, and
speak under correction of better judges; but we confess that the
everlasting monotonous alternation of the thunder of the spheres and
the softness of nightingales, of the notes of the trumpet and the lute,
the forked lightning and gentle moon-beams, Mr. Braham’s thick-set
person, infantine gestures and dying cadences, all together throw us
into a fit of despondency. Miss Fanny Ayton’s shrill voice and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>acute features did not serve to dispel our chagrin. The rest of the
piece was tolerably cast. Wallack was the hero of it, who does not
want for spirit or confidence; and a man’s good opinion of himself is
always half-way towards deserving it, and obtaining that of others.
Cooper did not play his pretended master well: he is too grave and
straight forward an actor for these sort of sudden shifts and doubtful
subterfuges. The best-done scene was the quarrel between Russell
as the tailor, and Harley as <em>Petruchio’s</em> man, about the gown and
cap. The quaint antique humour was happily hit off, and studiously
dallied with, so as not to slur it over, but to bring it out. Some
fastidious critics may object to the puerile conceit and tenuity of
meaning that pleased our ancestors in such idle squabbles—we think
we could cite graver polemics to match it in shabby excuses and
verbal trifling in the present day. The old-fashioned dresses recalled
the image of former times; and the scenery that of places, which
can never grow old. The last scene, in which the brides are sent
for and brought in, had an excellent effect; and the second representation
was announced with every sign of satisfaction. It may not
be improper to add here, that the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite> is one of the
pieces that have been transplanted (not without a good deal of
pruning) to the French stage, and that Mademoiselle Mars plays
the part of <em>Katharine</em> with equal spirit and success.</p>

<p class='c007'>M. Perlet took the <cite>Avare</cite> for his benefit at this theatre last week.
We are sorry we are about to lose this excellent actor, who has
given us much pleasure and instruction. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i> We saw him
only in the latter part of Moliere’s <cite>Miser</cite>: his thinness, his dress,
and the keys at his girdle fitted the character exactly. It was
chiefly in the scenes where he runs mad at losing his casket of
gold, or seizes on <em>Anselme</em> as the father of the supposed robber to
demand restitution of him, that the ruling passion and the greater
actor broke out. In the first of these scenes particularly, where he
catches hold of his own arm, thinking to arrest the thief, he shews
all the rage and phrensy of the most tragic vehemence; and in
throwing himself exhausted on the ground, bewailing his hard hap,
and appealing to the pity of an imaginary audience, whom his despair
conjures up, and then lashing himself up to impatience and fury
again, proves his entire acquaintance with the ebb and flow, the
risings and sinkings of the human heart. These particular passages
appeared to us, however, like patches or excrescences on the general
texture of the performance (perhaps they are so in the play itself,
which is not one of Moliere’s best). If we may hazard a conjecture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>on a subject on which we do not feel altogether <em>at home</em>, we should
say that M. Perlet’s <cite>Miser</cite> was in its ordinary aspect rather the
serving-man in a half-famished house, than a personification of the
demon of selfishness, fretfulness, and avarice. It was hard and
indifferent—not gloating enough, not morbid enough, not restless
and harassed enough. Farther, we suspect there is this fault in his
general acting and in French comedy: we grant it is not gross;
is it not, on the other hand, too slight and evanescent? They
charge us with over-doing; are they not then liable to under-do,
and fall short of the mark? If there is such a thing as caricature,
there is also an antithesis to it, and not only a danger of loading a
character to excess, but of giving a profile or section of it for the
whole, and not taking all the licence that truth and nature gives.
We are dreadfully afraid of being misled by national prejudices;
but (that being premised) we cannot but add our conviction that
M. Perlet’s acting, with all its purity, propriety, and spirit, wants
something of richness and breadth.—The little piece which followed
the <cite>Avare</cite>, <cite>Ninette à la cour</cite>, was delightful both in itself and as
giving Mademoiselle Fanny Vertpres an opportunity to display her
<em>mignon</em> figure and provoking ways. There seem to be two styles of
female coquetry in France, extreme flutter and vivacity, or perfect
calmness and self-possession. The one is set in motion by everything;
the other is put out of its way by nothing. Miss Fanny
Vertpres is of the latter class. With great presence of mind and
ready wit, she joins to the symmetry the apparent coolness and
indifference of a marble statue. She takes everything in good part,
and slides into a number of ticklish adventures and situations with all
the ease imaginable. She is only troubled at being laughed at—a
misfortune against which no French patience is proof. The scenes
behind the looking-glass and behind her fan with her rustic lover
(Laporte), whom she beguiles in an enchanting feigned voice
(prettier even than her own) are quite delightful, and dispose one
to believe that comedy has not yet exhausted all its precious stores.
Mademoiselle St. Ange played the <em>Countess</em> with all her country’s
ease and grace. Monsieur Laporte strikes us as a confirmation of
the remarks we have made above on French comedy, by the very
circumstance of his being an exception to them. There is nothing
<em>automatic</em> in his manner. He not only utters a jest, but he enjoys
it too—not that he forces it upon us either, except by the gentle
violence of sympathy. There is (so to speak) an atmosphere of
humour about him, which reflects the immediate object with kindly
warmth and lustre. His acting both in <cite>Maître Jacques</cite> and in the
after-piece evinced that easy play of feeling, that transition from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>grave to gay, that mixture of wit and folly, those natural varieties of
laughter and tears, which mark the master in his art and the genuine
son of Momus.</p>

<p class='c007'>We dropped in at Covent Garden to see Mr. Warde in the <cite>Seraglio</cite>
and Charles Kemble in <cite>Charles the Second</cite>, who seems really born for
the character, and whose fine person and accomplishments are thrown
away in these degenerate days. Mr. Power makes a very passable
Irish <em>Rochester</em>: but the wit and the rake had defects enough of his
own to answer for, without having the <em>brogue</em> added to them. The
same fault may be found with Mr. Warde, who would make a very
respectable actor in the middle walk of tragedy, could he but controul
his voice within the compass of the four seas.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has been no novelty this week at any of our theatres, English
or French, except that little Mademoiselle Jenny Vertpre has been
metamorphosed into a cat, and has been playing in the <cite>Pie Voleuse</cite> at
the Lyceum. She played the first charmingly; the last prettily,
though we have seen it done better. There is a <em>calibre</em>, a weight of
metal in Miss Kelly’s pathos, which the French actress is without.
Our lively neighbours are doubtless ‘born to converse, to live, and <em>act</em>
with ease’—all is set in motion like a feather, stopped like a feather.
Smiles play upon the lips, tears start into their eyes and are dried up
for nothing; an exclamation and a sigh settle the account between
life and death; all is a game at <em>make-believe</em>, thoughtless and innocent
as childhood, in the baby-house of their imagination—but if you wish
to see the heart-strings crack, go and see Miss Kelly in the <cite>Maid of
Palisseau</cite>; or if you would see the stately pillar of Tragedy itself fall
and crush the subjected world, then you should have witnessed Mrs.
Siddons formerly in some of her overwhelming parts. That was a
flood of tears indeed—a drinking of the brimming cup of human joys
and woes to the very last drop, the recollection of which may serve
one all the rest of one’s life. We understand that not long ago Sir
Walter Scott and Mrs. Siddons met in the same room before Mr.
Martin’s picture of the <cite>Fall of Nineveh</cite>—two such spectators the
world cannot match again, the one by the common consent of mankind
the foremost writer of his age, the other in the eyes of all who saw
her prime or her maturity, the queen and mistress of the tragic scene.
Forgive us, gentle, ever-living shade of Jenny Deans, agonised soul of
Balfour of Burley, heroic spirit of Rebecca of York, immortal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>memory of Dumbie Dikes and of a thousand more, if we should have
turned from you and from him who invented you, to bow the knee and
kiss the hem of the garment of her who represented to our youthful
gaze the Mourning Bride, Hermione, Belvidera, Beverley’s wife, and
was the Muse of Tragedy personified. We are sorry that Mrs.
Siddons has abridged <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, and that Sir Walter has written
a triumphant peroration over ‘the worst, the second fall of man.’ We
are perhaps runagates and Goths; but the smell of the links that used
to ply between Covent garden and Drury lane prevails in our imagination
over all the heather-bloom of Scotland, and we declare that Mrs.
Siddons appears to us the more masculine spirit of the two. Sir
Walter (when all’s said and done) is an inspired butler, a ‘Yes and No,
my Lord’ fellow in a noble family—Mrs. Siddons is like a cast from
the antique, or rather like the original, divine or more than human,
from which it was taken. Yet close to each other, within narrow
space, were placed two heads, on which glory sat plumed, beat two
hearts over which had rolled the volume of earth’s bliss or woe, were
interchanged glances that had reflected the brightness of the universe.
Who would not rather see Sir Walter Scott’s fringed eyelids and
storied forehead than the vacant brow of prince or peer? When
Mrs. Siddons used to sit in parties and at drawing-rooms, the Lady
Marys and the Lady Dorothys of the day came and peeped into the
room to get a glance of her, with more awe and wonder than if it had
been a queen. This was honour, this was power. There was but one
person in the world who would have drawn the gaping gaze of curiosity
from these and from all the crowned heads in Europe; and Sir
Walter exults that he perished like a felon in the grasp of a jailor.
We must indeed admire the talents, when we forgive the use of them:
or is it that genius, with its lofty crest and variegated colours, seems
destined like the serpent to lick the dust, and crawl all its life with its
belly on the ground? We can reckon up in our time three great
tragic performers; Mrs. Siddons, Mr. Kean, and Madame Pasta.
(If there is a fourth instance, we either know not of it, or it is Miss
Kelly: but that in a parenthesis, as our private opinion, or that of
persons no wiser than ourselves.) Of these three, Mrs. Siddons seemed
to command every source of terror and pity, and to rule over their
wildest elements with inborn ease and dignity. Her person was made
to contain her spirit; her soul to fill and animate her person. Her
eye answered to her voice. She wore a crown. She looked as if
descended from a higher sphere, and walked the earth in majesty and
pride. She sounded the full diapason, touched all chords of passion,
they thrilled through her, and yet she preserved an elevation of thought
and character above them, like the tall cliff round which the tempest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>roars, but its head reposes in the blue serene! Mrs. Siddons combined
the utmost grandeur and force with every variety of expression
and excellence: her transitions were rapid and extreme, but were
massed into unity and breadth—there was nothing warped or starting
from its place—she produced the most overpowering effects<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c009'><sup>[42]</sup></a> without
the slightest effort, by a look, a word, a gesture. Mr. Kean, in the
intellectual and impassioned part, is in our judgment equal to any one,
but he produces his most striking effects by fits and starts, without the
same general tone and elevation of character, and, for want of the
instrumental advantages, with an appearance of effort and sometimes
of extravagance. Madame Pasta, on the contrary, never goes out of
her way, never aims at effect or startles by any one pointed passage,
nor does she combine a variety of feelings together (as far as we have
seen) but she rises to the very summit of her art, and satisfies every
expectation by absolute and unbroken integrity of purpose, and by the
increasing and unconscious intensity of passion. She has neither Mr.
Kean’s inequalities nor Mrs. Siddons’s scope: she neither deviates
from the passion nor rises above it, but she commits herself wholly to
its impulse, borrows strength from its strength, ascends with it to
heaven, or is buried in the abyss. In a word, she is the creature of
truth and nature, and joins the utmost simplicity with the utmost
force. This has little to do with Mademoiselle Jenny Vertpre: ah!
she is charming too, and we hope to have a great deal to say in her
praise—twenty years hence. She counts her silver spoons inimitably,
and when she is suspected of stealing one of them says, ‘<i><span lang="fr">C’est
desagreable</span></i>,’ in a voice and manner that none but a Frenchwoman can.
The <cite>Misanthrope</cite> and the <cite>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</cite> have been repeated at
this theatre; and M. Perlet has done equal justice to Moliere’s sententious
gravity in the one, and to his delightful flighty farce and
fanciful exaggeration of folly in the other. Moliere is our Wycherley
and O’Keefe, both in one: or it might be said that he possessed the
critical sense of Montaigne, with the exuberant mirth and humour of
Rabelais.—We believe this little theatre, with its lively company and
excellent pieces, answers tolerably well, as most French theatres do.
We were thinking of this the other evening, and thought we had
accounted for it. The French performances, with a tenth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>audience, pay better than the English with ten times the number and
receipts. How so? It arises, on a critical inquiry, from the unity
of place, which is the fundamental law of the French drama. One
barbarism leads to another;—a slight technical distinction involves
manager after manager in bankruptcy and ruin. Where there is no
change of situation, the scenery is the same; and where this is the
case, it is no object either of attraction or expense. Little more is
required than a drop-scene. Therefore, all you have to do is to get
good plays, and a good company to perform them: three or four
hundred people in the house will maintain a dozen or a score of
comedians on the stage; and the excellence of the performance and
the taste of the town keep pace with one another, and with the absence
of show and extrinsic decoration. But with us all this is reversed.
The scene travels, and our scene-shifters, scene-painters, mechanists, and
the whole theatrical <em>commissariat</em> go along with it. The variety, the
gaudiness, the expense is endless: to pay for the getting up such an
immense apparatus, the houses must be enlarged to hold a proportionable
rabble of ‘barren spectators:’ the farther off they are thrown,
the stronger must be the glare, the more astonishing the effect, and
the play and the players (with all relish for wit or nature) dwindle into
insignificance, and are lost in the blaze of a huge chandelier or the
grin of a baboon. We do not see the features of the actors, but we
admire (very justly) Mr. Stanfield’s landscape back-grounds, or a
castle set on fire by Mr. Farley; we hear the din and bray of the
orchestra, not the honeyed words of the poet; and still we wonder
that operas and melo-drames flourish, and that the legitimate stage and
good old English Comedy languishes. Poor old green curtain! when
thou wast withdrawn to make room for gas lights and shining marble
pillars, the last relic of the heart-felt pageant faded; and the <i><span lang="la">Veluti in
speculum</span></i> flew after <em>Astræa</em> to the skies!</p>

<p class='c007'>The new comedy in three acts brought out at this theatre on Tuesday
evening is, we apprehend, taken from a French piece, entitled <cite>Les
Trois Quartiers</cite>. The Three Quarters of the town indicate the three
sorts or stages of society, as they are to be met with in the <cite>Rue St.
Honoré</cite>, the <cite>Rue Mont Blanc</cite>, and the <cite>Fauxbourg St. Germain</cite>, which
may be supposed to answer (we speak under correction of the Secretary
of the Admiralty, skilled as he is in the transitions from low to high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>life) to our Fish-street-hill, Russell and Grosvenor square. It was
thought a nice distinction in Miss Burney, forty years ago, to place
the residence of the Harrells in Portman square, and to assign
Grosvenor square to the Delville family; the one being considered
as the resort of the upstart fashionables, the other of the old gentry.
To know whether this court-geography holds good in the present year,
see the files of the <cite>John Bull</cite>, or the <cite>Last Series of Sayings and Doings</cite>,
where such matters are noted and discussed with a becoming want of
elegance and decorum, which is made up for by the innate loftiness of
the subject. In the French piece, a rich adventurer from South
America is introduced into these different circles by an officious go-between,
as a travelled prodigy, <i><span lang="fr">un homme qui a vu</span></i> Bolivar; and in
each his perplexity and astonishment increases with the progress and
refinement of manners in the <em>Three Quarters</em> of the town. There is
some sense in that; and the French actors have the skill to make the
line of demarcation intelligible. But here we vow that though we
shift the scene, no progress is made; or we are <em>at the top of the tree</em>
in the second stage. <em>Kitty Corderoy</em> is sufficiently forward and vulgar,
it is true; <em>Amelia Mammonton</em> is naturally elegant and genteel; but
we get no farther; or rather <em>Lady Charlewood</em> is a falling off, having
neither natural nor acquired grace; and the <em>Countess Dowager
Delamere</em> is distinguished by nothing but a rude and harsh familiarity
of manner. The Banker (Mr. Cooper) has evidently the advantage
of the Lord (Mr. Hooper); and <em>Jack Pointer</em> (Mr. Jones) a busybody
and toad-eater, carries it hollow by dint of sheer impudence and
impertinence. Mr. Jones’s Bond street slang—‘She’s a delicious
creature’—is echoed every five minutes by <em>Lady Delamere’s</em>—‘You’ll
excuse my freedom, <em>Lady Charlewood</em>;’ the changes are rung upon
a few and slender notes of fashion, while the author has the full range
of the Cockney dialect, and sinks deep in the bathos of low life. <em>Mrs.
Corderoy</em>, we observe, is played by a Mrs. C. Jones. Is Mr. Jones
lately married? If so, we congratulate him: she is an excellent cook.
We could wish the accomplished author of <cite>Killing no Murder</cite>, he who
dips his pen so carelessly in poison or honey, the expert <em>improvisatori</em>
in fact or fiction, would turn his thoughts to this matter; give us a
comedy or criticism to show our actors or play-wrights what they
ought to do in these degenerate days; and from his ease of access to
palaces or princes, give us a taste of true refinement, the court-air, the
drawing-room grace, the after-dinner conversation, the mornings and
the evenings of the great, instead of confining his abilities to teaching
young gentlemen at Long’s how to eat their fish with a silver fork:
the waiters might do that just as well. Or could not Mr. Croker,
now that Augustus has given peace to sea and land, and who shakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>epics and reviews from his brow ‘like dew-drops from the lion’s mane,’
<em>smile</em> a comedy that should point the nice gradations from the city to
the court—</p>

<p class='c016'>and make it for ever impossible for Cheapside to pass Temple-bar or
Russell-square to step into the Regent’s Park? We understand, indeed,
that Mr. Colburn has a plan in contemplation to remedy all this, and
that we may look forward to the dawn of a new era in literature,
through the happy idea which the little bookselling Buonaparte has
conceived of establishing an inviolable <em>Concordat</em> between the world of
genius and fashion. The proposal is to buy up the manuscripts of all
authors by profession, to lock them in a drawer, so as to put the whole
corps of Garretteers and Grub street writers on the shelf, and leave the
door open to none but persons of quality and amateurs, lords, ladies,
and hangers-on of the great. The scheme has in a great measure
succeeded in the periodical department, and only requires a little
management to be extended to the stage. What an air already
breathes from the New Parnassus! What a light breaks over Drury-Lane
and Covent-Garden! What delicacy, what discrimination, what
refinement of sentiment! What halycon days! What peaceable productions!
There will be no grossness, no violence, no political allusions
or party spite! The best understanding will subsist between
Government and men of letters, nor will there be any occasion for a
Dramatic Censor, when Ministers of State furnish the plot, and
Peeresses in their own right suggest the last corrections to the dialogue.
There is no doubt the taste for the drama will be revived by means
of such an arrangement—people of fashion will go to see what people
of fashion write—the manners of high life will be reflected on the
stage as in the mirrors at each end of the dress circle—</p>

<p class='c016'>the hireling crew will withdraw to hide themselves in a garret or a
jail—the pit will wonder—the galleries be silent or shut up—Lord
Porchester’s tragedy will be crowned with bays, Lord Morpeth’s
transferred from the closet to the stage—Mr. Moore, by particular
desire of several persons of distinction, will try his hand at another
<em>Blue-Stocking</em> affair—and the <cite>Sphynx</cite>, the <cite>Athenæum</cite>, the <cite>Argus</cite> (a
new evening), and the <cite>Aurora</cite> (a new morning paper), which Mr.
Buckingham will by that time have set up on the same independent
principles of voluntary contribution, will applaud to the skies the
change which Mr. Colburn’s spirit and genius will have brought like
a perfect paradise upon earth. It is whispered that a certain Duke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>has got through the first act of a piece, called ‘The Deaf and Dumb
Politician,’ but dreads the vulgar composition of the public taste:—nay,
who knows but the coast being cleared of plebeian scribblers and
the rabble of competitors, Majesty itself might not take the field, the
<em>Lady Godiva</em> of the scene, in a night-gown and slippers, with a grand
romantic interlude called ‘The Prince and the Pretender, or the
Year 1745’—with Mr. O—holding the glass-door in Burlington
street for three days together in his hand, and Mr. C—p—b—ll to
officiate as <cite>Peeping Tom</cite>—‘Oh! dearest Ophelia, we are ill at these
numbers:’ but neither <cite>Ups and Downs</cite> nor <cite>Carron-Side</cite> suggested
anything better. Mr. Liston in the first played a city fortune-hunter,
who pays his addresses to, who jilts, and is jilted by three mistresses
in succession, to whom he is introduced by <em>Jack Pointer</em> (Jones),
his pretensions rising with his fortune, and with whom he is confronted
and exposed without much effect in the last act. He at
first aspires no higher than to <em>Kitty Corderoy</em>, a tradesman’s daughter;
but having twenty thousand pounds left him, he contrives to cut with
her, to her great joy, she being secretly in love with <em>Mr. Christopher
Higgins</em> (Russell), her father’s apprentice, a person by no means
approved by her mother <em>Mrs. Corderoy</em> (Mrs. C. Jones), because he
himself is ‘a little sneaking chap,’ and his father a tailor—as if
tailors were not in the order of nature or of civil society. Our hero,
that is, <em>Mr. Felix Mudberry</em>, next offers himself, with a large bunch
of flowers and a suit of clothes picked up on the way at the <em>Readymade
Depôt</em>, to <em>Miss Amelia Mammonton</em> (the charming Miss Ellen
Tree), a banker’s sister, who is in love with <em>Earl Delamere</em> (Mr.
Hooper), love and romantic sentiment, according to the situation or
rank in which it is found, aiming at still greater and more airy
heights. She laughs at him and his ‘delicate attentions’ (as she
well may)—but being led to suppose that his uncle, <em>Mr. Stanley</em>, a
Liverpool merchant, or as he used to call him ‘<em>Black Boy Billy</em>,’
is dead, and has left him a fortune of half a million, he begins to
blubber out his sorrow for his uncle’s death and his own ‘good, he
means, bad fortune,’ stammers his excuses for leaving the company of
<em>Mr. Mammonton</em> and his sister, and is wound up to a Countess by his
mischievous prompter. <em>Lady Charlewood</em> (Miss I. Paton) is disgusted
with the behaviour of her new and absurd admirer; her
mother, the <em>Countess Dowager Delamere</em> (Mrs. Davison), admires
his fortune, and patronises the match according to the etiquette of
rank and high life. His inconstancy and meanness are however
exposed in the meantime by <em>Miss Kitty Corderoy</em>, who is intimate
with both the young ladies, having been at the same school with
them somewhere in the neighbourhood of London, and runs up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>down ‘the Ladder of Life’ as she pleases (in the French play the
corresponding character is a milliner, which is a little more in keeping)—and
<em>Mr. Felix Mudberry</em>, in his own emphatic phrase, is
‘blown’ by all the three at once;—the bubble of his legacy also
bursts, and <em>Jack Pointer</em> turning short round upon him at this
extremity, advises him to go abroad again, make another fortune,
and on his return, promises to introduce him to a Princess! Mr.
Liston produced a good deal of laughter in the part, but perhaps
from not being near enough to see his face, the drollery fell flat upon
us. It was (to get within bow-shot of an Hibernicism) like hearing
the report of a pistol, before seeing the flash. Weepers and a round
hat do not move our risible muscles. We think Mr. Liston shines
in the cockney, more than in the cockney and dandy together.
‘He knows his cue best without a prompter.’ His affectation even
must be unaffected. We will match his lead against anybody’s, we
will not answer for the tinsel. We have a delicate request to make
of him, that he would play <em>Madge</em> for his benefit and our satisfaction—unless
<em>Moll Flagon</em> should complain of it as compromising her
dignity. Is this piece Mr. Kenney’s? It shivers on the brink of
nothing, and plunges over head and ears into nonsense. We wish
our authors and architects, if they must give us foreign models,
would give them entire, and not by bits and samples, altering only to
spoil.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Carron-Side, or the Fête Champêtre</cite>, a new Opera, the words by Mr.
Planche, the music by M. Liverati, was brought out here on Tuesday,
and was repeated on Thursday. The dialogue is tolerable;
and so are the songs. Miss Stephens was the chief attraction in it;
though she does not make much figure by Scottish stream or
mountain. Mr. Sapio and Mr. Wood personated, the one a military,
the other a naval hero in it, and maintained the superiority of their
several professions in song and bold defiance—with equal loudness
and skill. Miss Stephens (<em>Blanche Mackay</em>) the supposed daughter
of a peasant, is in love with <em>Captain Allan Lindsay</em> (Sapio), and he
with her, though he is about to be married to <em>Grace Campbell</em> (Miss
Cawse), who likes another of her cousins, <em>Cornet Hector Lindsay</em>
(Mr. Wood) quite as well or better, as far as we could judge by the
event. When <em>Blanche</em> has to present a <em>bouquet</em> to the intended couple
on the morning of their nuptials, and to sing a song of congratulation,
her voice falters and she faints away in the midst of it. She then,
partly through shame and partly through vexation, escapes to the
house of the miller (Little Keely) and his wife (Miss Goward),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>where she is kindly received, but supposed by her own friends to
have rashly drowned herself. The anguish of <em>Captain Allan Lindsay</em>
is not to be restrained on this occasion, and betrays his passion for the
unhappy girl, who is at the same time discovered not to be the real
daughter of the old trumpeter <em>Donald Mackay</em> (Bartley), but the
daughter of <em>Mrs. Campbell</em>, who had been supposed to be lost when
an infant in the Spanish campaign. The mystery being cleared up,
the secret of her birth is communicated to poor <em>Blanche</em> amidst her
smiles and tears. <em>Miss Grace Campbell</em> under the circumstances, and
from her previous indifference, declares for <em>Cornet Lindsay</em>, and
<em>Blanche</em> is united to the Captain. Mr. Keely crept on and off the
stage as usual; and Miss Cawse danced and flourished round it as she
sung, because Madame Vestris does so. We are quite satisfied with
Madame Vestris, without wishing to see her imitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not wonder at Mr. Kean’s want of success in Paris. As
they do not like or understand Shakespear, it is not to be supposed
they should like or understand any one who goes near to represent
him, or who gives anything more than a trite version or modernised
paraphrase of him. Voltaire has borrowed largely from the English
dramatist, and has taken <em>Othello’s</em> dying speech almost entire, as far
as the prose-ground of it, but has contrived to leave out all the
striking, picturesque points of it:—so they would no doubt object
to and cancel, by a sweeping condemnation, all the unexpected and
marked beauties of an impassioned recitation of it. Whatever is not
literal and conventional, is with them extravagant and grotesque:
they have so long been accustomed (we are speaking of serious
matters) to consider affectation as nature, that they consider nature
when it comes across them as affectation and quaintness.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>So the actor’s eye (if truly inspired) comprehends more than is set
down for him, starts at hidden fancies that only pale passion sees;
and his voice is the trembling echo and the broken instrument of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>thoughts and of an agony that lie too deep for mere words to express.
This licence, that is, this truth of nature is, with our accomplished
and more thorough-bred neighbours, entirely out of the question.
Their art, whether in poetry, acting, painting, is well-drilled regimental
art:—it is art in uniform and on parade. Thus tragic poetry
cannot, in its dumb despair, call on all nature to supply it with an
appropriate language, that places what it feels in palpable and lofty
imagery before the reader: it must, on the contrary, have its
rhetorical and didactic flourishes all ready for the occasion—these
may be as tedious, as pompous, as bombastic as you please, but to
pass or allude to anything beyond them, is vile and Gothic indeed.
The actor may mouth, rant, and whine as much as he pleases, so
that he does it in measured time, and seems in perfect health and
spirits all the while; but if he is once thrown off his guard, and
loses sight of himself and the audience in the sufferings of his hero,
it is all over with him. Again, an actor’s face ‘should be as a book
where one may read strange matters.’ This would be an inexpiable
offence in France, where there is nothing strange, and where all
must appear upon the surface or be kept quite out of sight, on the
score of decency and good manners. As the poet must introduce
no image or sentiment for which there is not a prescribed <em>formula</em>,
so the tragedian must give no shade or inflection of feeling which the
entire audience were not prepared complacently to anticipate. The
self-love of the pit would rise in open rebellion if he did. In
France it is a rule that no person is wiser than another: you cannot
be beforehand with their conceit and infinite superiority in impertinence.
So they themselves tell the story of a man who, hearing of
the assassination of the Duke of Berri, and not willing to allow that
his informant had the start of him on so interesting a topic, made
answer—‘Yes, I knew it!’ We are not therefore surprised that
the Parisians find fault with the only actor of much genius we
possess: he must puzzle them almost as much as the Hetman Platoff;
and this assuredly they cannot forgive, as in the present case their
rank cowardice cannot get the better of their consummate vanity.
It is ludicrous too that they should charge us with extravagance and
fustian—they, who have their <i><span lang="fr">Pensions de l’Univers</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr">Diligences
de l’Univers</span></i><a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a> stuck on every pillar and post! As we know what
the most refined people in the universe do not like, we are also happy
in learning what they do like. For others to despise what we
admire, is always to assume an attitude of seeming superiority over us:
to admire what we do not think much of, is to give us our revenge
again. Fastidiousness is here, as in many other cases, the effect not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>of an excess of refinement, but of a want of conception. When
Voltaire called Shakespear a barbarian, we were a little staggered in
our previous opinion, as we could not tell what lofty models of
excellence he contemplated in his own mind; but when he pronounced
Addison’s <cite>Cato</cite> to be a perfect tragedy, we knew what to
think of him and ourselves. He might as well have pronounced a
marble slab to be a perfect statue. In like manner, it might ‘give
us pause’ that such competent critics are dissatisfied with Mr. Kean,
if we did not learn in the same breath that they are in raptures with
Mr. C. Kemble, Mr. Macready, and Miss Smithson; not that we
disapprove of the last, but that being our own country people, we
beg leave to judge of their relative merits better than foreigners. If
they scouted our pretentions altogether, we might despond; but as
they <em>laud</em> us in the wrong place, we may smile in our turn. The
contradiction between us is not owing to an inferiority of nature,
but to a difference of opinion. We can understand why, with
reason, they admire Macready: he declaims well, and so far
resembles good French actors. Mr. C. Kemble is not only an
excellent actor, but a very good-looking man; and good looks are a
letter of recommendation, whether among the Laplanders or Hottentots,
at Zenith or the Pole. Miss Smithson is tall; and the
French admire tall women. All these come under a class, and
meet with obvious sympathy and approbation. Mr. Kean, on the
other hand, stands alone,—is merely an original; and the French
hate originality: it seems to imply that there is some possible excellence
or talent that they are without! Beside it appears that
they expected him to be a giant. <i><span lang="fr">Mon Dieu qu’il est petit!</span></i>—as if
this was an insuperable bar to his bestriding the theatric world like a
Colossus. He is diminutive, it is true: so was the <em>Little Corporal</em>:
but since the latter disappeared from the stage, they have ceased to
be the <em>Great Nation</em>. They stir up our bile by their arrogance and
narrow-mindedness, and we cannot help its overflowing in some
degree of ill-humour and petulance. We were heartily glad to find
that Mr. Knowles’s tragedy of <cite>Virginius</cite> is well received in Paris—(we
would always rather agree with, than differ from them, for we
know their subtlety and double edge)—but this is to be attributed to
the inherent and classical excellence of the composition. Its scenes
present a series of elegant bas-reliefs, and are equally enchanting to
the eye and to the ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have received a letter from a Correspondent, praying us to put
down the large poke-bonnets which ladies at present take with them
to the theatre, and often persist in keeping on, as a female privilege.
We confess, we do not see the custom in that amiable light: it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>appears to us the privilege of annoying others without any object.
He says, that on applying to a gentleman in the gallery of the King’s
Theatre, to know if a lady with him would have any objection to
take off her bonnet, which, with her involuntary movements from
side to side, prevented three persons behind her from seeing or enjoying
the Opera, her friend answered, ‘You see she is in the same
situation with yourself,’ pointing to another lady just before her. So
that the evil being doubled was an argument for it. At this rate,
people might go to the play with umbrellas, and hold them open the
whole time,—or ladies with their parasols, if we must have a more
light and portable nuisance,—and by thus setting up a screen to the
performance, and making the absurdity truly English and complete,
put an end to it by common consent of those who are only bent on
incommoding others, when they think they are in some degree
singular in doing it. We expect some novelty (of which we have had
a dreary dearth of late) on the opening of the Haymarket Theatre
next week, and a treat, which we greatly long for, in little Bartolozzi.
But we must not count upon our good fortune too soon.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This theatre opened on Saturday with <cite>The School for Scandal</cite> and
<cite>Past Ten O’clock</cite>. The chief novelty in the former was Munden’s
<em>Sir Peter Teazle</em>. We cannot speak very favourably of it. He did
not feel at home in the part, which is indeed quite out of his way.
His lengthened visage and abrupt tones did not suit the character or
sentiments of <em>Sir Peter</em>. <em>Sir Peter</em> is a common every-day sort of
character, a tetchy amorous old bachelor, who has married a young
wife, with an uneasy consciousness of his own infirmities, and placed in
situations to make those infirmities more ridiculous. But still he is a
classical character, and not a grotesque; and, therefore, the actor’s
peculiar talents were thrown away upon him, or rather were
judiciously kept as much as possible in the back-ground, and hardly
dared to show themselves once the whole evening. Mr. Munden
went through the part with laudable gravity and decorum, without
<em>making any hole in his manners</em>; nor did he purposely play the clown
or <em>pantomime</em> in any of the scenes. Yet the negation of farce is not
comedy. <em>Sir Peter</em> was a knight newly dubbed as well as married,
a gentleman on his good behaviour both with his mistress and the
public. We missed the irresistible expansion of his broad, shining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>face; and reckoned up a number of suppressed shrugs, and embryo
grimaces, that shrunk from the glare of the new gas lights. His
eyebrows were not lifted up with wonder; his lips were not moistened
with jests as with marmalade; nor did his chin drop down once its
whole length as with a total dislocation of his ideas. In the scene of
the discovery in the fourth act, where his wife as ‘the little <em>French
Milliner</em>’ is concealed behind the screen, he took a greater license,
but from the mechanical restraint to which he had been subjected,
there was something even here dolorous and petrified in his manner.
If, however, Mr. Munden did penance in <cite>Sir Peter</cite>, it was a holyday-time
with him, high carnival in <cite>Old Nosy</cite> in the farce, where he made
himself and the audience amends for all the temptations he had
resisted to indulge his natural genius, and let out his whole faculties
of face, voice, and gesture. In his character, as an old steward, he
is reeling-ripe from the beginning to the end of the piece; and he
produces a dizziness in the heads of the audience as unavoidable,
though more pleasant than that which overtakes the passengers in a
Margate hoy. The <cite>School for Scandal</cite> was, in the other characters,
cast much as usual, and as well as the strength of the company in
genteel comedy would permit. Mrs. Davison’s <em>Lady Teazle</em>, though
not without spirit, is too coarse and hoydening. Wallack’s <em>Joseph
Surface</em> wanted dignity and plausibility. Not to compare him with
old Jack Palmer, he does not hit off the officious condescending
solemnity of the character so well as Young. He seems sulky and
reserved, instead of being self-complacent and ostentatious; to shrink
into a cautious contemplation of his own designs and villainy, instead
of protecting others under the shadow of his assumed virtues, and
covering their failings and defects with a veil of pompous sentiment.
It was said of Garrick, that he played the footman too like the fine
gentleman; Mr. Wallack, on the other hand, plays the fine gentleman
too much like the footman. When dressed to most advantage,
he puts us in mind of a valet out of livery. Mr. Rae’s <em>Charles
Surface</em> was without any thing to recommend it, but the wit, gaiety,
and magnanimity of the author. His mode of speaking is more harsh
and untuneable in comedy than in regular declamation, which in some
measure hides its habitual defects. It is a brogue in full gallop
suddenly stopped short by the turnpike gate of criticism. Harley’s
<em>Sir Benjamin Backbite</em> was inoffensive from its insipidity; and Knight
as old <em>Crabtree</em> had painted his eyebrows very naturally. The house
was not very crowded. The curtain drew up punctually at seven,
without any previous expression of impatience; and the play was
over before ten: but the rapidity with which the acts followed one
another, and the almost immediate interruption of the music between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>the acts as soon as it had struck up, produced on us an unpleasant
effect. It was like going a journey in the mail-coach, where they do
not allow you time for your meals. A good play, like a hearty
dinner, requires some time for digestion: the music in the orchestra
acts upon the imagination, like wine upon the stomach; and habit
makes it as ungrateful to us to be disappointed of the one as to be
deprived of the other.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This theatre opened last night with <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and the <cite>Miller and his
Men</cite>. The chief improvement in the house seems to us to be the
large mirrors at each end of the first row of boxes, which reflect the
company in a brilliant perspective, and have a very magical effect.
The great chandelier suspended from the top of the theatre, we should
admire more, if it did not put out our eyes in looking at it; nor
do we think the glare it produces any addition to the general appearance
of the company or the house. The only advantage resulting
from it—that of throwing the light upon the countenances of the
actors from above instead of from below (which last method inverts
the natural shadows of the face, and distorts the expression), is
defeated by the gas lights which are still retained between the stage
and the orchestra. Nor do we know how these can well be dispensed
with, as it is by raising or withdrawing them that the stage is
enlightened or darkened as the occasion requires it. The house was
exceedingly full, and the play went off as well as could be expected.
Mr. Young’s <cite>Hamlet</cite> is not his most happy or successful effort. He
in a great measure imitates Mr. Kemble, and Mr. Kemble is a bad
model in this part; even where he is original he is not more what he
ought to be, not more like <cite>Hamlet</cite>. He declaims it very well, and
rants it very well; but where is the expression of the feeling?—where
the thought beyond all ordinary means of expression, wrapped
up in itself as in a dim cloud, shown most by being hid, that derives
its energy from rest, not from action, and is as it were audible from
its very silence? Mr. Young, we allow, rehearsed several passages
very well, as detached passages from a school-boy’s exercise: but he
wanted keeping—the fine inflections, sudden or gradual, of the
character—the unthought-of swellings of the passion—the involuntary
ebbing and flowing of his idle purposes. This actor in fact executes
his conception well: but then his conception is either common-place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>or wrong. He has not always the judgment or the genius to pitch
each passage in the right key, and in harmony with the rest. We
will mention only two instances. In reciting the description of man
as the noblest of creatures, ‘the paragon of animals,’ &#38;c., Mr. Young
was so vehement, that he seemed quite angry; and his sudden turning
round to the players at the conclusion of the speech was exactly as if
they had given him some serious offence by their ‘smiling.’ Again,
he spoke the soliloquy after the scene in which the player gives the
description of Pyrrhus, in a style not conveying the idea of his own
melancholy and weakness as contrasted with the theatrical fury of the
imaginary hero, but as if he had himself caught by mere physical infection
the very fury which he describes himself to be without. This
was certainly not right, but (what is perhaps better) it was applauded.
Mr. Bonnell Thornton was <em>Horatio</em>, and appeared not to have recovered
all the evening from his fright at first seeing the <em>Ghost</em>. His pronunciation
is thick, as if he spoke with pebbles in his mouth; nor is
his emphasis judicious. Mr. Egerton’s <em>Ghost</em> is the most substantial
we ever saw. He does not look like one that has ‘peaked or pined’
long, and has by no means realized <em>Hamlet’s</em> wish—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Matthews played ‘the pretty <em>Ophelia</em>’ very pleasingly. She
is as good an <em>Ophelia</em> as we have lately seen—better, we think than
Miss Stephens, because she does not sing <em>quite</em> so well. This character
ought not indeed to be in general given to a fine singer; for it
has been well observed, that ‘<em>Ophelia</em> does not go mad because she
can sing, but she sings because she has gone mad.’</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The excellent comedy of <cite>The Hypocrite</cite> was acted here last night.
Dowton’s <em>Dr. Cantwell</em>, is a very admirable and edifying performance.
The divine and human affections are ‘very craftily qualified’
in his composition, which is a mixture of the Methodist parson ingrafted
on the old French pietist, and accomplished Abbé. The
courtly air of Moliere’s <cite>Tartuffe</cite> has been considerably lowered down
and vulgarised to fit the character to the grossness of modern times
and circumstances: only the general features of the character, and
the prominent incidents of the story, have been retained by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>English translator, and they seem to require the long speeches, the
oratorical sentiments, and laboured casuistry of the original author
to render them probable or even credible. It has been remarked,
that the wonderful success of this piece on the French stage is
a lasting monument of the stress laid by that talking and credulous
nation on all verbal professions of virtue and sincerity, and of the
little difference they make between words and things. With all
the pains that have been taken to bring it within the verge of
verisimilitude by the aid of popular allusions and religious prejudices,
it with difficulty <em>naturalizes</em> on our own stage, and remains at last
an incongruous, though a very striking and instructive caricature.
Dowton’s jovial and hearty characters are his best; his demure and
hypocritical ones are only his second best. His <em>Dr. Cantwell</em> is
not so good as his <em>Major Sturgeon</em>, or his <em>Sir Anthony Absolute</em>, but
still it is very good. Their excellence consists in giving way to the
ebullition of his feelings of social earnestness, or vainglorious ostentation;
the excellence of <em>this</em> in the systematic concealment of his
inmost thoughts and purposes. <em>Cantwell</em> sighs out his soul with the
melancholy formality of a piece of clockwork, and exhibits the
encroachments of amorous importunity under a mask of <em>still life</em>.
The locks of his hair are combed with appropriate sleekness and
unpretending humility over his forehead and shoulders: his face
looks godly and greasy; his person and mind are well fortified in a
decent suit of plain broad cloth, and the calves of his legs look stout
and saint-like in stockings of dark pepper-and-salt fleecy hosiery.
Bitter smiles contend with falling tears; the whining tones of the
conventicle with the insolence of success, and the triumph of his
unbridled rage in the last act over his phlegmatic hypocrisy is complete.
He was admirably supported by Mrs. Sparks, as old <em>Lady
Lambert</em>, and by Oxberry as <em>Mawworm</em>. This last character is as
loose and dangling as the sails of a windmill, and is puffed up and
set in motion by one continuous blast of folly and fanaticism. The
other characters in the piece were less happily supported.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this theatre last night Miss Brunton appeared in <em>Rosalind</em>, in
<cite>As you Like it</cite>. She certainly played the part very respectably and
very agreeably, but not <em>exquisitely</em>; and if it is not played exquisitely,
in our mind it is spoiled. ‘But would Shakspeare’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span><em>Rosalind</em> do so?’ is a question that, if put home as it ought to be,
might deter many an accomplished young lady from attempting to
give life to the careless, inimitable graces of this ideal creation of the
poet’s art. Miss Brunton recited the different passages with considerable
point, intelligence, and archness, like a lively and sensible
school-girl, repeating it as an exercise; but she was not half giddy,
fond, and rapturous enough for <em>Rosalind</em>. She spoke her sentences
with ‘good emphasis and discretion,’ instead of running herself and
the imaginations of the audience fairly out of breath with pleasure,
love, wit, and playful gaiety. She has, however, white teeth and
black eyes, a clear voice, a pleasing figure, with youth on her side,
and a very good understanding to boot. What more can be required
in a young actress, except by fastidious critics like us? She sung
the <em>Cuckoo</em> song very prettily, and was encored in it. The other
parts were not very elaborately got up. We liked Mr. Duruset’s
two songs as well as any thing else. Mr. Young’s <em>Jaques</em> was less
spirited than we have sometimes seen it: indeed, the character is in
some measure spoiled to his hands by the prompt-book critics, who
have put a great deal of improper praise of himself into the mouth of
the melancholy <em>Jaques</em>. It required some contrivance to make him
or Shakspeare an egotist! Mr. Fawcett’s <em>Touchstone</em> was amusing,
but too rapid and slovenly. There are some parts of this character
which the actor probably thinks it becoming his Managerial dignity
to hurry over as fast as possible. Mrs. Gibbs’s <em>Audrey</em> is almost
too good. If ‘the gods have not made her poetical,’ they have at
least inspired her with the very spirit of folly, and with all its bliss.
A Russian ballet, and <cite>The Libertine</cite>, closed the entertainments of
the evening. The former of these is a curious exhibition of Russian
costume, but it does not exhibit the Miss Dennetts to any advantage.
The play of <cite>As you Like it</cite> was given out again for Monday, instead
of <cite>The Slave</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Maywood appeared here in <cite>Zanga</cite> last night. It is not certainly
from any wish to discourage, but we cannot speak so favourably of
his performance of this character as of his <em>Shylock</em>. Considerable
diffidence still appears in this actor’s manner, and retards his progress
to reputation and excellence. He does not give sufficient scope and
vehemence to the impassioned parts of the character, nor sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>decision and significance to its wily and malignant duplicity. <em>Zanga’s</em>
blood is on fire; it boils in his veins; it should dilate, and agitate his
whole frame with the fiercest rage and revenge: and again, the
suppression of his constitutional ardour, of the ungovernable passions
that torment and goad on his mind, ought to be marked with a
correspondent degree of artful circumspection and studied hypocrisy.
In both extremes (for the character is in extremes throughout) we
thought Mr. Maywood failed. His rage and hatred, where it had
opportunity to vent itself in a torrent of exclamations, was not
strong or sustained enough, and appeared in the very tempest and
whirlwind of the passion, to recoil affrighted ‘from the sound itself
had made.’ In the concealment of his purposes, and in the villainous
insinuations with which he fills <em>Alonzo’s</em> mind, ‘distilling them like
a leprous poison in his ear,’ he was ‘too tame,’ too servile and
mechanical, and resembled more the busy, mercenary, credulous
tale-bearer, than the dark, secret assassin of the peace, life, and
honour, of his unsuspecting patron. The passage in which Mr.
Maywood failed most, and in which the greatest symptoms of disapprobation
manifested themselves, was that in which the greatest
effect is generally produced, and where consequently the expectations
are raised the highest: we mean, in the terrific and overpowering
exclamation to <em>Alonzo</em>, ‘’Twas I that did it!’ In the long and
nasal emphasis which Mr. Maywood laid on the monosyllable ‘I’
he shocked the ears and tired the patience of the auditors; less, we
apprehend, from any thing wrong in his conception of the part, than
from the remains of a provincial accent hanging on his pronunciation,
and in passages of great vehemence and ardour, preventing him from
having the full command of his utterance. In the less violent
expression of passion, he was more successful; and gave one or two
of the short soliloquies which occur of a more thoughtful and
reasoning cast, with considerable depth of tone and feeling. We are
not without hopes, when Mr. Kean returns, and imparts some of his
confidence and admirable decision to his young rival or pupil, of
seeing some very good acting <em>between</em> them: we say so without meaning
a double-entendre.</p>

<p class='c007'>This play of <cite>The Revenge</cite> is certainly a very indifferent piece of
work; and in the hero of the story, <em>Alonzo</em>, Mr. Rae <em>bolted</em> some
very ranting speeches, blank verse and all, clean out of his mouth like
shot from the mouth of a cannon, with a tone and emphasis that
might have startled ears less accustomed to the ‘forced gait’ and
high clattering hoofs of his voice than ours. By stamping so hard,
too, he raises not only a shout in the upper-gallery, but a cloud of
dust from the green baize on the stage-floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kean has returned to us again (after no very long absence),
in the character of <cite>Richard the Third</cite>. His performance of the part
is so well known to the public, and has been so often criticised, that
it would be superfluous to enter into particulars again at present.
We observe no great alteration in him. If any thing, his voice is
deepened, and his pauses are lengthened, which did not need to be.
His habitual style of acting is apt to run into an excess of significance;
and any studied addition to that excess necessarily tasks the
attention to a painful degree. Mr. Pope resumed his situation as
<em>King Henry</em>, and was stabbed in the Tower, according to the rules
of art. We were glad to see him in the part, though we should
have no objection to see the part itself omitted, to make room for the
fine abrupt beginning of Shakspeare’s <cite>Richard the Third</cite>, with the
soliloquy, ‘Now is the winter of our discontent,’ &#38;c. In our
opinion, the <cite>Richard the Third</cite> which was manufactured by Cibber,
and which has now obtained prescriptive possession of the stage, is a
vile jumble; and we are convinced that a restoration of the original
play (as written by the original author) would, with the omission
of a few short scenes, be an advantage to the managers, and a gratification
to the public. We understand, indeed, that something of
this sort has been in agitation; and in order to contribute any little
aid in our power to so laudable an attempt, we shall here give a few
of the passages which are omitted in the common stage representation,
but which appear to us particularly calculated for stage
effect, and which would also fit Mr. Kean’s peculiar style of acting,
as the glove fits the hand. One of these occurs almost immediately
after the first opening soliloquy, in the dialogue between <em>Glo’ster</em> and
<em>Brackenbury</em>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo’ster.</em>—Even so! an’ please your worship, Brackenbury,</div>
      <div class='line'>You may partake of any thing we say;</div>
      <div class='line'>We speak no treason, man:—we say, the king</div>
      <div class='line'>Is wise and virtuous; and his noble queen</div>
      <div class='line'>Well strook in years: fair, and not jealous:</div>
      <div class='line'>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</div>
      <div class='line'>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue:</div>
      <div class='line'>That the queen’s kindred are made gentle folks:</div>
      <div class='line'>How say you, Sir? can you deny all this?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brackenbury.</em>—With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span><em>Glo’ster.</em>—What, naught to do with mistress Shore?</div>
      <div class='line in30'>I tell thee, fellow,</div>
      <div class='line'>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Were best to do it secretly, alone,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Brackenbury.</em>—What one, my Lord?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo’ster.</em>—Her husband, knave:—Would’st thou betray me?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We think, if any thing could give additional effect to the fine
taunting irony of these lines, it would be Mr. Kean’s mode of delivering
them. He is almost the only actor who does not spoil Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, a very spirited scene of a different description, which is
an astonishing mixture of violence and duplicity, occurs when <em>Glo’ster</em>
rushes into the apartment where the <em>Queen’s</em> friends are assembled,
to complain of their taking advantage of his meekness and simplicity:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo’ster.</em>—They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who are they that complain unto the king,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</div>
      <div class='line'>By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly,</div>
      <div class='line'>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours!</div>
      <div class='line'>Because I cannot flatter, and speak fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,</div>
      <div class='line'>Duck with French nods, and apish courtesy,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</div>
      <div class='line'>Cannot a plain man live, and think no harm,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thus his simple truth must be abus’d</div>
      <div class='line'>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Grey.</em>—To whom in all this presence speaks your Grace?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Glo’ster.</em>—To thee, that hast nor honesty, nor grace?</div>
      <div class='line'>When have I injured thee? When done thee wrong?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?</div>
      <div class='line'>A plague upon you all!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is certainly an admirable conclusion to so modest an introduction.
Any one who reads this passage, and who has seen Mr. Kean acquit
himself in similar situations, must, we think, feel with us a desire to
see him in this. We might multiply these instances of characteristic
traits in the adroit and high-spirited <em>Richard</em>. We shall give one
more, which is so fine in its effect, and besides, conveys so striking a
picture of the outward demeanour which an actor, to fulfil the poet’s
conception, ought to assume in the part, that we cannot resist giving it
entire. It is the scene where he entraps the unsuspecting <em>Hastings</em>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Hastings.</em>—His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning:</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s some conceit or other likes him well,</div>
      <div class='line'>When he doth bid good-morrow with such spirit.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>I think, there’s ne’er a man in Christendom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;</div>

      <div class='line'>For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Re-enter <em>Glo’ster and Buckingham</em>.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Glo’ster.</em>—I pray you all, tell me what they deserve</div>

      <div class='line'>To doom the offenders: whosoe’er they be,</div>
      <div class='line'>I say, my lord, they have deserved death.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Is, like a blasted sapling, wither’d up;</div>
      <div class='line'>And this is Edward’s wife, that monstrous witch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>Hastings.</em>—If they have done this deed, my noble lord—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>Off with his head! Now by St. Paul I swear,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will not dine until I see the same.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lovell and Catesby, look that it be done.</div>
      <div class='line'>The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Now this is despatching business in the true dramatic style. Poets
cannot take the same bold licenses, with their characters on the stage,
till kings are reinstated in their former plenitude of power. The
incident which is here omitted in the acting play of <cite>Richard III.</cite> has
been transferred to Rowe’s <em>Jane Shore</em>. We should like to see it
restored to its original place, and justice done it by Mr. Kean’s
distorted gestures, and smothered voice, suddenly bursting on the ear
like thunder.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Wonder</cite>, or <cite>A Woman keeps a Secret</cite>, was performed here last
night with admirable effect. Miss Brunton was the heroine of the
piece, the charming <em>Violante</em>. We cannot speak in rapturous terms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>of her performance of the part. There is in the character itself an
extreme spirit, and at the same time an extreme delicacy, which it is
not easy to unite. Miss Brunton went through the different scenes,
however, with a considerable degree of grace, vivacity, and general
propriety, never falling below, and seldom rising above mediocrity.
She does not</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Snatch a grace beyond the reach of art;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>nor, according to another line of the same poet, which seems to convey
a perfect idea of female comic acting,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Catch ere she falls the Cynthia of the minute.’</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We have already objected to this young lady’s recitation, a certain
didactic, monotonous <em>twang</em>, and we cannot upon the present occasion
recant our criticism. Miss Foote was <em>Violante’s</em> friend, <em>Donna
Isabella</em>, and looked and lisped the part very mincingly. Charles
Kemble’s <em>Don Felix</em> is one of his best parts. He raves, sighs, starts,
frets, grows jealous, and relents, with all the characteristic spirit of
an amorous hero; and in the drunken scene with old <em>Don Lopez</em>,
where he produces his pistol as the marriage-contract, is particularly
excellent and edifying. Fawcett played <em>Lissardo</em> as he plays almost
every thing: he chattered like a magpie, and strutted like a crow in a
gutter. But Emery’s <em>Gibby</em> was the thing: the genius of Scotland
shone through his Highland plaid and broad bluff face: he seemed
evidently afraid neither of having his voice heard, nor his face seen.
In person he resembled the figure of the Highlander which we see
stuck up as a sign at tobacconists’ windows. We never see nor wish
to see better acting than this. Emery’s acting is indeed the most
perfect imitation of common nature on the stage. Abbott was respectable
as <em>Colonel Briton</em>. Mrs. Gibbs’s <em>Flora</em> was what every waiting-woman
ought to be.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Otway’s noble tragedy of <cite>Venice Preserved</cite> was produced here last
night. The effect upon the whole was not satisfactory. The novelties
of the representation were Mr. H. Johnstone as <em>Pierre</em>, and Miss
Campbell (from the Dublin Theatre) as <cite>Belvidera</cite>. Of Mr. Johnstone’s
<em>Pierre</em>, after having seen Mr. Kemble in it, or even Mr. Young, we cannot
speak in terms of applause. The character is not one of blunt energy,
but of deep art. It is more sarcastic than fierce, and even the fierceness
is more calculated to wound others than to shake or disturb himself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>He is a master-mind, that plays with the foibles and passions of others
and wields their energies to his dangerous purposes with conscious
careless indifference. Mr. Johnstone was boisterous in his declamation,
coarse in his irony, pompous and common-place in his action.
Mr. Rae (as <em>Jaffier</em>), in the famous scene between these two characters,
displayed some strong touches of nature and pathos. Miss Campbell,
as <cite>Belvidera</cite>, did not altogether realize our idea of Otway’s heroine;
one of ‘the most replenished sweet works of art or nature.’ Her
face, though not handsome, is not without expression; but its character
is strength, rather than softness. In her person she is graceful, and
has a mixture of dignity and ease in her general deportment. Her
voice is powerful, but in its higher tones it rises too much into a
scream, and in its gentler ones subsides into a lisp, which is more infantine
than feminine. In her general style of acting she put us sometimes
in mind of Mrs Fawcit, sometimes of Miss Somerville, and
more than once of Miss O’Neill. Her delineation of the part, if not
sufficiently tender or delicate, was however forcible, impassioned, and
affecting. We thought the last scene, in which she goes mad, and digs
for her murdered husband in the grave, the best. We should indeed
give her the preference over Miss O’Neill in this very trying scene.
Her expression of the disordered wanderings of the imagination, and
of the last desperate struggles of passion in her bosom, both by the
intonations of her voice, and the varying actions of her body, were more
natural, and less repulsive than the mere physical violence of Miss
O’Neill in the same passage. The play was given out for repetition
with some marks of disapprobation from a part of the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goldsmith’s comedy of <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite> was played at this
theatre last night: its reception was highly favourable. It bears the
stamp of the author’s genius, which was an indefinable mixture of the
original and imitative. His plot, characters, and incidents, are all
new, and yet they are all old, with little variation or disguise—that is,
the writer sedulously avoided common-place, and sought for singularity,
but found it rather in the unhackneyed and out-of-the-way inventions
of those who had gone before him than in his own stores. His <cite>Vicar
of Wakefield</cite>, which abounds more than any of his works in delightful
and original traits, is still very much borrowed from Fielding’s <cite>Joseph
Andrews</cite>. Again, the characters and adventures of <em>Tony Lumpkin</em> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>his mother in the present comedy are a counterpart, even to the
incident of the theft of the jewels, of those of the <em>Widow Blackacre</em>
and her booby son in Wycherley’s <cite>Plain Dealer</cite>. The change of
character and the rustic disguise of <em>Miss Hardcastle</em>, by which she
gains her lover, are also a faint imitation of <em>Letitia Hardy</em> in <cite>The
Belle’s Stratagem</cite>. This sort of plagiarism, which gives us a repetition
of what are comparatively new and eccentric pictures of human life, is
much to be preferred to the dull routine of trite, vapid, every-day
common-places: but it is also more dangerous, as the stealing of pictures
or family plate, where the goods are immediately identified, is
surer of detection than the stealing of bank-notes or the current coin
of the realm. Johnson’s sarcasm against some writer that ‘his singularity
was not his excellence,’ cannot be applied to Goldsmith’s works
in general: but we do not know whether it might not in severity be
applied to <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite>. The incidents and characters are,
some of them, exceedingly amusing; but it is a little at the expense
of probability and <em>bienseance</em>. <em>Tony Lumpkin</em> is certainly a very
essential, and unquestionably comic personage; and his absurdities or
his humours were very effectually portrayed by Liston. His impenetrability
and unconscious confusion of mind and face in reading and
spelling out the letter was admirable. Charles Kemble’s bashful
scene with his mistress was irresistibly ludicrous, and excellently well
played: but still it did not quite overcome our incredulity as to the
existence of such a character in such circumstances. It is a highly
amusing caricature, a ridiculous fancy, but no more. One of the
finest and most delicate touches of real acting we ever witnessed was
in the transition of this modest gentleman’s manner to the easy and
agreeable tone of familiarity with the supposed chambermaid, which
was not total and abrupt, but exactly such in kind and degree as such
a character of natural reserve and constitutional timidity would undergo
from the change of circumstances. Miss Brunton’s <em>Miss Hardcastle</em>
was a very correct and agreeable piece of acting. Mrs. Davenport’s
<em>Mrs. Hardcastle</em> was like her acting in all such characters, as good as
it could possibly be.</p>

<p class='c007'>Macbeth (with Matthew Lock’s music) was played here last night.
Mr. Kean was <em>Macbeth</em>, Miss Campbell <em>Lady Macbeth</em>. We never
saw the former to such advantage in the part. Mr. Kean’s <cite>Macbeth</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>did not use to be a great favourite with us, except in the murder scene:
but he last night, we thought, lifted the general character to
almost an equality with this single scene. At least, he played the
whole in a style of boldness and grandeur which we have not seen
before. He was ‘proud and lion-hearted, and lacked fear.’ A
thousand hearts seemed swelling in his bosom. His voice rolled from
the bottom of his breast like thunder, and his eye flashed scorching
flame. Instead of going back (as some cunning critics who have been
peeping out of their cells at him ever since he began his career, to
watch for his first failure, and to fall upon him magnanimously at a
disadvantage, have been predicting), he advances even beyond himself
with manly steps and a heroic spirit. In the banquet-scene he was
particularly excellent; and called forth, with complete effect, those
deep tones of nature and passion, recoiling upon and bursting with a
convulsive movement from the heart, which are his very best and
surest resource, though he has as yet made the least use of them.
Let him go on, and open all the sluices of passion in his breast which
are yet unlocked. He has done much: let him do as much more,
by giving as much depth of internal emotion (where it is required) as
he has done of external vehemence, by adding stateliness and a
measured march to infinite force and truth, that he may be the greatest
poet, as he unquestionably is the greatest prose-actor of the stage.
When we speak of him as deficient in these qualities, we only do so
in comparison with Mrs. Siddons: it would be a mockery both of him
and the public to compare him with any one else. But she had something
of <em>divine</em> about her which Mr. Kean has not; he in general only
shows us the utmost force of what is <em>human</em>. Of Miss Campbell’s
<em>Lady Macbeth</em> we are almost afraid to speak, because we cannot speak
favourably of it; yet a failure in this part is by no means decisive
against the general merits of an actress. But she was altogether too
tame and drawling for <em>Lady Macbeth</em>; and some attempts at originality
failed of effect from the timidity with which they were executed.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Othello</cite> was played here on Saturday to a crowded house. There
were two new appearances—Mr. Maywood as <em>Iago</em>, and a young lady
as <em>Desdemona</em>. The name of this young <em>debutante</em> is not announced;
but her reception was exceedingly flattering. Her face is handsome,
her person elegant, her voice sweet, and her general deportment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>graceful and easy. There was also a considerable portion of tenderness
and delicacy of feeling in several of the passages; but perhaps less
than the character would bear. The only faults which we think it
necessary to mention in her performance were, a too continual movement
of the hands up and down, and sometimes a monotonous cadence
in the recitation of the blank verse. Mr. Maywood’s <em>Iago</em> had some
of the faults which we have noticed in his former characters; but in
the most trying scenes in the third act with <cite>Othello</cite>, we thought him
exceedingly happy and successful. His conception was just, and his
execution effective. There was a cold stillness in his manner which
was more frightful than the expression of the most inveterate malignity.
He seemed to crawl and watch for his prey like the spider,
instead of darting upon it like the serpent. In the commencement of
the part his timidity appeared to prevent him from doing justice to his
intention, and once or twice his voice grew loud and unmanageable,
so as to excite some marks of disapprobation. Mr. Kean’s <cite>Othello</cite> is,
we suppose, the finest piece of acting in the world. It is impossible
either to describe or praise it adequately. We have never seen any
actor so wrought upon, so ‘perplexed in the extreme.’ The energy
of passion, as it expresses itself in action, is not the most terrific part;
it is agony of his soul, showing itself in looks and tones of voice. In
one part, where he listens in dumb despair to the fiend-like insinuations
of <em>Iago</em>, he presented the very face, the marble aspect of Dante’s
<em>Count Ugolino</em>. On his fixed eyelids ‘Horror sat plumed.’ In another
part, where a gleam of hope or of tenderness returns to subdue the
tumult of his passions, his voice broke in faltering accents from his
overcharged breast. His lips might be said less to utter words, than
to bleed drops of blood gushing from his heart. An instance of this
was in his pronunciation of the line ‘Of one that loved not wisely but
too well.’ The whole of this last speech was indeed given with exquisite
force and beauty. We only object to the virulence with which he delivers
the last line, and with which he stabs himself—a virulence which
<cite>Othello</cite> would neither feel against himself at that moment, nor against
the turbaned Turk (whom he had slain) at such a distance of time.
His exclamation on seeing his wife, ‘I cannot think but <em>Desdemona’s</em>
honest,’ was ‘the glorious triumph of exceeding love;’ a thought
flashing conviction on his mind, and irradiating his countenance with
joy, like sudden sunshine. In fact, almost every scene or sentence in
this extraordinary exhibition is a master-piece of natural passion. The
convulsed motion of the hands, and the involuntary swellings of the
veins of the forehead in some of the most painful situations, should
not only suggest topics of critical panegyric, but might furnish studies
to the painter or anatomist.</p>

all the justice it deserves. But the great attraction of this piece, as it
is at present acted, is Miss O’Neill’s <cite>Belvidera</cite>. In this, however,
we think her less excellent than on her first appearance in it. Her
pathos is less simple, less touching, and her action more outrageous and
violent. Perhaps the reason of this change may be, that, acting in
such parts from an impulse of real sympathy with the heroine, as she
repeats the character, her immediate interest in it becomes gradually
diminished, and she is compelled to make up for the want of genuine
feeling by the external vehemence of her manner. Be this as it may,
she at present carries this violence of manner to the utmost pitch at
which it can be borne. Her screams almost torture the ear, her looks
almost petrify the sight. It is time that she should return to her first
style of acting, which did not ‘o’erstep the modesty of nature.’ We
speak thus of her from a sense of justice, and of respect, not of contempt,
for her powers: for we think she owes it to those powers <em>not to
abuse them</em>. As <cite>Belvidera</cite> is one of her most prominent characters,
we shall take this opportunity to sum up in a few words our opinion
of her general merit as a tragic actress; and perhaps we shall be able
to do this best by pointing out the difference between her and another
celebrated performer of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kean affects the audience from the force of passion rather
than of sentiment, or subsides into the pathetic after the violence of
action, but seldom rises into it from the depth of natural feeling. In
this respect, he presents almost a direct contrast to Miss O’Neill.
Her energy appears to rise out of her sensibility: distress takes
possession of, and overwhelms, her faculties: she triumphs in her
weakness, and vanquishes by yielding. Mr. Kean is chiefly great
in the conflict of passions, and resistance to his fate—in the opposition
of his will to circumstances—in the keen excitement of his understanding.
It is not without some reluctance, and after a good deal of
reflection, that we should say, that the finest parts of his acting are
superior to the finest parts of hers: for instance, to her parting with
<em>Jaffier</em> in <cite>Belvidera</cite>,—to her terror and joy in meeting with <em>Biron</em> in
<cite>Isabella</cite>,—to the death-scene in the same character,—and to the scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>in the prison with her husband as Mrs. Beverley. Her acting is more
correct, equable, and faultless throughout than Mr. Kean’s, and it is
also quite as overpowering at the time, in the most impassioned parts;
but it does not leave the same impression on the mind afterwards. It
adds little to the stock of our ideas, or to our materials for reflection,
but passes away with the momentary illusion of the scene. And this
difference of effect perhaps arises from the difference of the parts they
have to sustain on the stage. In the female characters which Miss
O’Neill plays, the distress is in a great measure physical and involuntary,
or such as is common to every woman in similar circumstances.
She abandons herself to the impulses of grief or tenderness, and revels
in the excess of an uncontrollable affliction. She can call to her aid
with perfect propriety and the greatest effect, all the weaknesses of
her sex; tears, sighs, convulsive sobs, shrieks, death-like stupefaction,
and laughter more terrible than all: but it is not the same in the parts
which Mr. Kean has to act. There must here be a manly fortitude,
as well as a natural sensibility. There must be a restraint constantly
put upon the feelings by the understanding and the will. He must in
part be ‘as one in suffering all, who suffers nothing.’ He cannot
give way entirely to his situation or his feelings, but must endeavour to
become master of them and of himself. This, in our conception,
must make it more easy to give the utmost effect and interest to
female characters on the stage, by rendering the expression of the
passion more simple, obvious, and natural; and must also make them
less rememberable afterwards, by leaving less scope for the exercise of
intellect, and for the distinct and complicated reaction of the character
upon circumstances. At least, we can only account in some such way
for the different impression which the acting of these two admired
performers makes on our minds, when we see or when we think of
them. As critics, we particularly feel this. Mr. Kean affords a
never-failing source of observation and discussion: we can only praise
or blame Miss O’Neill. The peculiarity and the strong hold of Mrs.
Siddons’s acting was, that she in a wonderful degree united both the
extremes of excellence here spoken of, that is, the natural frailties of
passion, or its inarticulate and involuntary expression, with a commanding
strength of intellect, and the loftiest flights of imagination. Her
person could also endure more violence of action than Miss O’Neill’s;
whose tender frame is hardly able to ‘abide the beating of so strong a
passion,’ as she often has to assume, and whose fair face is injured by
the least distortion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The favourite comedy of the <cite>Honey Moon</cite> was performed here
last night; the part of the <em>Duke</em> by Mr. H. Johnston. Upon the
whole he acquitted himself well in it, with spirit and effect. More
than that the character does not require; and it would be hard if the
critic required of the actor what the poet has not clearly and
intelligibly exacted from him. When, indeed, an accomplished
performer, who happens to be a man of genius, lends additional
graces to a character, and places it in a brilliant light of his own, we
are bound to thank him: when he merely gives ‘what is set down
for him’ with force and fidelity, we are bound to be content. Mr.
Johnston, we thought, sometimes too coarse, and sometimes too
sarcastic; but in this sort of assumption of character, it is hard to
say exactly how far the habitual manners and sentiments are to
modify and appear through those which are put on to answer the
purpose of the moment. In this species of the <em>mock-heroic</em>, which
is a sort of equivocal mixture of comedy and tragedy, half pompous
and half playful, Elliston, who was the first <em>Duke Aranza</em>, excelled
all those who have succeeded him. ‘Plautus was too light, Seneca
was too heavy for him.’ He just aspired to something above comedy,
he just fell short of tragedy; but <em>he hit the stage between wind and
water</em>. Mr. H. Johnston’s energy is more fierce, his irony more
virulent: but still he moved, and looked, and spoke, if not like a
lord, like a very lordly husband, and gave the essential interest to
the part. He danced much at his ease, and recited the speech in
which the Duke describes his idea of what his wife’s dress should
be, with propriety and feeling. Knight’s countryman was admirable:
his hysteric laughter at the dispute between his host and hostess, and
his sheepish confusion when discovered, were equally perfect. His
wonder at the manner in which Johnston rates his wife was ecstatic:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And near him sat ecstatic Wonder,</div>
      <div class='line'>Listening the hoarse applauding thunder.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>His jaws relaxed to their utmost expansion, and his nose ‘grew
sharp as a pen.’ Miss Kelly was too pert and forward, and too
much like my lady’s chambermaid. Nor can we speak in praise of
Mrs. Davison’s <em>Juliana</em>. She pouts, flounces, and lumbers about
the stage strangely. Mr. Harley did the <em>Mock Duke</em> well; he
seemed like Sancho Panza in his government. The <cite>Honey Moon</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>is a very pleasing drama: it is a cento of passages from old plays
modernized; it is an ingenious plagiarism from beginning to end.
The author was a most incorrigible pilferer, but so expert in his art,
that we would say to other authors, ‘Go thou and do likewise!’</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Mr. Kean</em>, after an absence of nearly six weeks, owing to serious
indisposition, last night resumed his professional duties at this theatre,
in the arduous character of <cite>Richard the Third</cite>. He was received on
his appearance with all that warm greeting and enthusiastic applause,
which are perhaps the highest meed of histrionic talent, and which
are unfailingly called forth by this distinguished actor, after every
suspension, however short, of the exercise of his art. This expression
of good-will was increased, we think, in the present instance, by
the recollection that the privation was caused by illness, and that it
was possible the stage might have been deprived of one of its
greatest ornaments. The acclamations, the waving of hats and
handkerchiefs, continued for some minutes. Mr. Kean looks somewhat
thinner than before his indisposition, but betrayed no deficiency
of power; on the contrary, on account probably of our having for
sometime past been doomed to witness very inferior performances, he
appeared to surpass himself. He exhibited all that energy and discrimination,
that faculty of identifying himself with the character he
represents, which is to be ranked among the greatest efforts of human
talents; he realized our conceptions of a being whose soul</p>

<p class='c016'>The fine passages of this piece of acting are well known to the
public; to quote them would be to extract the whole play. The
conclusion of his career was marked by nearly as much applause as
the commencement. The theatre was well filled, notwithstanding
the extreme wetness of the evening.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Shakspeare’s tragedy of <cite>King John</cite> was acted last night at this
theatre. Miss O’Neill performed the part of <em>Constance</em>; and
though everything undertaken by this excellent actress must have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>large proportion of good in it, we think that she is less successful in
this than in most of her other characters: for this, physical causes,
her youth for example, may be assigned; and her perfect delineation
of <em>Constance</em> is, perhaps, reserved to the maturity of her age and
her talents. She did not convey to us that warmth of temper, that
susceptibility to grief and anger, which mark this injured Princess.
Her speeches on the conclusion of the marriage with <em>Blanch</em>, which
admit great variety of expression, were simple declamation, without
passion and nearly in the same tone: but we would rather dwell on
beauties than defects. Two or three lines at the end of the scene
just mentioned made amends for all; when she says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To me, and to the state of my great grief,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let kings assemble.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>she utters the passage with beautiful feeling, and leaves nothing to be
wished. The burst of indignation when Austria endeavours to
silence her, subsiding instantly into a tone of the keenest contempt,
was no less striking. Her very best effort was on quitting the stage,
when, having uttered those pathetic exclamations for the loss of her
son, she goes out in all the wildness of despair, as if occupied by no
other thought than to seek him through the world. Young was a
little too violent in some parts of the character of <cite>King John</cite>; but,
on the whole, it may be considered a fine piece of acting: the two
scenes with <em>Hubert</em>, and his ‘dying scene, were excellent. <em>Faulconbridge</em>,
the bastard, is one of Charles Kemble’s happiest hits; his
manly figure, and martial appearance, well bear him out in his scoffs
at the <em>Duke of Austria</em>; he is no sooner knighted, than he seems
made for his rank, and leads out <em>Queen Elinor</em> like a ‘lordly gallant.’
Some of the nobles of <em>John’s</em> court did not convey the idea of much
dignity either in their dress or persons: we wish that the managers,
who have the power of issuing patents of nobility at pleasure, would
consider whether the general effect might not be improved by a little
more attention to this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>A debate has been lately going on, in the French House of
Commons, respecting the Liberty of the Press. M. Jollivet said,
‘the Liberty of the Press is less necessary in a Representative
Government than in any other.’ ‘The press’ he added, ‘is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>represented as the only instrument by which truth can be made
known; but the passions of men are too impetuous, to permit the
Press that liberty which some demand. <em>The real national representation
is in the King</em>;<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c009'><sup>[44]</sup></a>—the legitimate inheritance of his Crown, from
whence all powers and honours are derived, fixes there, with the
destinies of the people. This is the primitive representation, from
which all others emanate. There is the sacred depot of sovereignty.
The powers established by the Charter are only the means of that
sovereignty, for the dispensation of order and justice. We must then
leave out of the question this pretended influence of the Liberty of
the Press upon our representative Government, in favour of the
branch called the Democratic. We must reject principles which can
never return in France. By this course we may perhaps lose some
commentaries upon the rights of man, but all classes of society will
find their repose in it.’</p>

<p class='c007'>So says M. Jollivet; and so sings a modern bard:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c007'>Whether M. Jollivet, the French speaker, was one of the Orators
of the Human Race in the time of Robespierre, we do not know; but
this we know, that Mr. Coleridge was at that time delivering <i><span lang="la">Conciones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>ad populum</span></i> in a tone of mob-sycophancy, the height and heat of
which could, it seems, only be qualified by the doctrines of Divine
Right and Passive Obedience. The above exquisite morceau of
political logic, and dramatic recantation of the author’s popular
harangues, was intended for representation at Drury-Lane Theatre,
and was one of the passages pointed out, if we are to believe Mr.
Coleridge, as a reason for the rejection of this spurious offspring of
his loyal Muse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Southey has not yet given us a poetical version of the true <i><span lang="la">Jus
Divinum</span></i>. We should like to know what he says to this speech of
M. Jollivet—Content or Not Content—and whether this was the
result he anticipated when he so sweetly and loudly, about three years
ago, invited France ‘restored and shaking off her chain’ to join in
his (Mr. Southey’s) triumphal song,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<em>Glory to God on high, Deliverance to Mankind.</em>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Can that laurel wreathe which adorns his brows (if it still adorns
them) any longer hide or prevent those blushes, deep and lasting,
which should suffuse his once well-meaning face for having been
the shameful dupe of a cozenage so shameful?</p>

<p class='c007'>As to Mr. Wordsworth, another of these heroic deliverers, he
is ‘a full solemne man,’ and you cannot get much out of him.
But we should like to hear his opinion—Aye or No—of M.
Jollivet’s allied notions of liberty and the rights of man. Is this sort
of legitimate clapping down under the hatches the deliverance for
which he mouthed out deep-toned Odes and Sonnets? Is this
repose, the repose of lasting slavery and avowed, barefaced annihilation
of the rights of human nature, the consummation devoutly to be
wished, which kindled in him so much disinterested zeal against
all his old friends and feelings? If he were to say so, the very
echoes of his favourite mountains, ‘with thousand-fold reverberation,’
would contradict him. But he says nothing. He is profoundly
silent. He will not answer Mum to our Budget. From the elevation
of his former well-timed enthusiasm against tyrants and
conquerors, he slid into a place: and he will never rise out of it
by any ill-timed intemperance. <em>Snug’s the word.</em> St. Peter is well
at Rome; and Mr. Wordsworth is attached to the Excise. What
is it to him, seated on Rydal Mount, what M. Jollivet, a prating
Frenchman, says to that poor creature, Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII</span>? It is enough
for Mr. Wordsworth that he signs his stamped receipts and distributes
them:—he is not bound, <em>by his office</em>, to subscribe to M. Jollivet’s
doctrines, or to circulate them in this country. He is a customhouse
officer, and no longer a citizen of the world. He keeps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>himself quiet, like the philosopher of old, lest the higher powers
should hear him. If he were to mutter a syllable against any one act
of legitimate despotism, he knows (in his sleeve) that not all his odes
on Hoffer and Schill, and the Cortes, or even to the King, would
save him one hour. He is wise. After having endorsed the
accommodation bills of the Allied Sovereigns on liberty and independence,
with a pen which ought to have been sacred to humanity,
he now leaves it to the people of France, Spain, Italy, to us, to the
world, to take up these dishonoured forgeries, and will not utter a
word of resentment or indignation, or contempt, against those who
have made him a poor accomplice in a fraud upon mankind!</p>

<p class='c007'>This sort of shuffling on the side of principle, and tenaciousness on
the side of power, seems to be the peculiar privilege of the race
of modern poets. The philosophers, if not much wiser, appear to be
honester. Some of these had been taken in, but they want to be let
out. They declare off in time to save at least their own characters,
and will not sign and seal ‘a dateless bargain to all-engrossing
despotism,’ when she unfolds the long dark scroll of her rotten parchment
bonds to them, and they see it ‘stretching out even to the crack
of doom.’ They had got into a bad house, it is true, thinking,
though the owners were the same, they had changed their calling, in
company with an old bawd masked, who pretended to have just
escaped being robbed and ravished, if not murdered. They were
proud of such an opportunity of shewing their gallantry. But as soon
as the old lady pulled off her mask of Legitimacy, and shewed
herself ‘the same, that is, that was, and is to be,’ our philosophers
went to the window, threw up the sash, and alarmed the neighbourhood;
while the poets, either charmed, with the paint and patches of
the hag, or with her gold and trinkets, put a grave face upon the
matter, make it a point of conscience, a match for life—<em>for better
or worse</em>, stick to their filthy bargain, go to bed, and by lying
quiet and keeping close, would fain persuade the people out of doors
that all is well, while they are fumbling at the regeneration of
mankind out of an old rotten carcase, and threatening us, as the
legitimate consequence of their impotent and obscene attempts, with
the spawn of Bible and Missionary Societies, Schools for All, and a
little aiery of children, with a whole brood of hornbooks and catechisms,—a
superfetation more preposterous than that of Mrs. Tofts,
the rabbit-breeding lady in Hogarth.—Mr. Bentham was one of the
philosophers who were so taken in by the projects of the Holy
Alliance, but who did not chuse to continue so with his eyes
open. He had lent an ear to the promises of kings. He thought
tyrants had taken a sudden fancy to the abstract principles of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>sound legislation. With a little exuberance of philosophical vanity, and
a little want of philosophical penetration, he thought he could ‘charm
these deaf adders wisely.’ He thought absolute sovereigns, having
suffered persecution, had learnt mercy: that they were convinced, by
their own experience, of the value of justice, truth, and liberty. He
did not suspect their appeal to humanity was the cry of the crocodile
to allure and destroy: he, like many more, thought their tears were
‘drops which sacred pity had engendered.’ Not so. He soon
found his mistake; and no sooner found, than he hastes to amend it.
He does not try (half fool, half knave) to hush up the affair, to
screen their villainy, or salve his own idle vanity. Out the whole
story comes, in a book which he has just published,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c009'><sup>[45]</sup></a> containing an
account of the papers, and correspondence which passed between himself
and the Emperor Alexander. Mr. Bentham sent the autocrat a
plan of legislation, and the sovereign sent him a snuff-box in return.
The Emperor however took no other notice of the plan, and the
legislator returned the snuff-box. This was as it should be. It is
of course the favourite object of Alexander to be lord over millions
of slaves: it must be Mr. Bentham’s greatest ambition to be a wise
and honest man. He had committed his character for wisdom
sufficiently in supposing that the lord of millions of slaves would, in
the pure coxcombry of his heart, and in the giddy round of gold
snuff-boxes, and in his delight in the infinite multiplication of his
own pictures set in brilliants, set millions of slaves free! The
Emperor would as soon let Mr. Bentham cuckold him as resign his
people to the Platonic embraces of Mr. Bentham’s legislative genius.
But having gone thus far on a wrong calculation of the characters of
rulers, Mr. Bentham was too honest a man to try to repeat the imposition
upon others of which he had been made the momentary dupe
himself. He was not ambitious any longer to remain that tool</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Which knaves do work with, called a fool.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>He would not be made a mild decoy of humanity, and go a dottrel-catching
with the Emperor Alexander in Finland, in Poland, or in
South America. He would not be made an amiable stalking-horse
of liberty and equality for royal sportsmen to catch their silly prey,
the human race, and then to be turned loose, stripped of his netting
and his ribbons, to graze where he could. He had a spirit above it.
He could not brook this league with detected hypocrisy and barefaced
power. He had not the stomach to swallow a lie for truth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>He could not bring himself to say, or by any tampering with his own
mind to believe that a thing <em>was</em> what he knew <em>it was not</em>. He was
by habit a logician—by nature, a plain, literal man. ‘The Gods had
not made him poetical.’ That is, Mr. Bentham had not, like Messrs.
Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Southey, been playing at fast and loose
with fiction, till he could like them believe whatever he pleased of
matter of fact, and stand to it stoutly too with ‘a mingled air of cunning
and of impudence,’—to the equal satisfaction of his understanding
and his conscience!</p>

<p class='c007'>‘On Friday evening Mr. Coleridge gave his first Lecture on
Shakspeare to a numerous and genteel audience. He stated the
permanent objects Shakspeare had in view in drawing his characters,
and how obviously he disregarded those that were of a transitory
nature. The character of <em>Caliban</em>, as an original and caricature of
Jacobinism, so fully illustrated at Paris during the French Revolution,
he described in a vigorous and lively manner, exciting repeated
bursts of applause. He commenced an inquiry into the order of
succession in which Shakspeare wrote his plays, and decided that
<cite>Love’s Labour Lost</cite> must have been the first, as there are so many
allusions in it such as a youth would make, few or none resulting
from an experience of the world. That play and <cite>The Tempest</cite> were
the chief objects of his discourse, into which, however, he introduced
a great variety of new and striking remarks, not confined to any
particular play. As for instance, he said, wherever Shakspeare
had drawn a character addicted to sneering, and contempt for the
merits of others, that character was sure to be a villain. Vanity,
envy, and malice, were its certain accompaniments: too prudent to
praise itself, it fed its concentrated egotism by sarcasm and lowering
others. This is but a poor description of the very glowing language,
ample detail, and profound thought, Mr. Coleridge displayed on this
topic, which produced a thunder of applause.’—<cite>Courier</cite>, Feb. 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Coleridge, in his prospectus, modestly observed, that the
attending his course of Lectures on Poetry, and ‘those fair parts
that there adjacent lie,’ would enable any grown gentleman to talk
on all subjects of polite conversation, except religion and politics.
By the above extract, and from what we have heard, it should
appear that Mr. Coleridge has gone beyond his engagement, and
given his grown gentleman a slice of religion and politics in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>dish with his account of the Dark Ages. Not like a lady who puts her
mind into the postscript, Mr. C. does that first which he promised
last. Whatever may be the case with his metaphysical hypercriticisms,
his religious and political opinions seem pretty transparent. As he
has sent a passage against Jacobinism to his friend Mr. Stuart, of
the <cite>Courier</cite>, we wonder that he could not (as he still retains all his
old sentiments, with only the advantage of new light added to them)
have vamped up a sly passage from his <cite>Conciones ad Populum</cite>, in
favour of the <em>so-called</em> Jacobin principles he formerly professed, to
have sent it to us. We should gladly do all in our power to assist
Mr. Coleridge in publishing a harmony of his opinions, which are, we
suspect, too liberal and multifarious to be comprised, in all their speculative
and practical bearings, in a shabby Evening Paper. As to this
argument about <em>Caliban</em>, we suspect it must have been sadly curtailed
and <em>scissarsed</em> by Mr. Stuart, in order to fit his cloth to his coat,
and to bring Mr. Coleridge’s ‘unhouselled free conditions into the
circumscription and confine’ of the Editor’s party politics. <em>Caliban</em>
is so far from being a prototype of modern Jacobinism, that he is
strictly the legitimate sovereign of the isle, and <em>Prospero</em> and the
rest are usurpers, who have ousted him from his hereditary jurisdiction
by superiority of talent and knowledge. ‘This island’s
mine, by <em>Sycorax</em> my mother;’ and he complains bitterly of the
artifices used by his new friends to cajole him out of it. He is
the Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> of the enchanted island in <cite>The Tempest</cite>: and Dr.
Stoddart would be able to prove by the civil law, that he had the
same right to keep possession of it, ‘independently of his conduct
or merits, as Mr. Coke has to his estate at Holkham.’ Even his
affront to the daughter of that upstart philosopher <em>Prospero</em>, could
not be brought to bar his succession to the natural sovereignty of his
dominions. His boast that ‘he had peopled else this isle with
<em>Calibans</em>,’ is very proper and dignified in such a person; for it is
evident that the right line would be supplanted in failure of his
issue; and that the superior beauty and accomplishments of <em>Ferdinand</em>
and <em>Miranda</em> could no more be opposed to the legitimate claims of
this deformed and loathsome monster, than the beauty and intellect
of the Bonaparte family can be opposed to the bloated and ricketty
minds and bodies of the Bourbons, cast, as they are, in the true
<i><span lang="la">Jus Divinum</span></i> mould! This is gross. Why does Mr. Coleridge
provoke us to write as great nonsense as he talks? Why also does
he not tell, in his general ‘lunes and abstractions,’ what to think of
<em>Prospero’s</em> brother, the Duke, who usurped his crown, and drove
him into banishment; or of those finished Court-practitioners, <em>Sebastian</em>
and <em>Antonio</em>, who wanted to murder the sleeping King? Were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>they Jacobins like <em>Caliban</em>, or legitimate personages, like Mr. Coleridge?
Did they belong to the new school or the old? That is
the question; but it is a question which our lay-preacher will take
care not to answer. Shakespear, says Mr. Coleridge, always spoke
of mobs with contempt, but with kindness. Mr. Coleridge does
better: he speaks of mobs with contempt, and of Courts with
kindness. Again, says this critical discoverer of a meaning in a
millstone, <em>Caliban</em> had that envy of superior genius and virtue, which
was a mark of the true Jacobins in the time of the French Revolution.
We are sorry to hear, that on one occasion Mr. C. was
interrupted in a tirade upon this favourite topic, on which he was
led out of pure generosity, to enlighten the grown gentlemen who
came to hear him, by a person calling out in good broad Scotch,
‘But you once praised that Revolution, Mr. Coleridge!’ The
worst is, that Mr. Coleridge praised that Revolution when it was
triumphant, going on ‘conquering and to conquer,’ as it was thought;
and now that it is fallen, this man of mighty mind,—of gigantic
genius, and superiority to interested motives and mob-sycophancy,
insults over it,—tramples on the carcase,—kicks it with his asinine
hoofs,—and brays a long, loud, dreary, doleful bravura over it. Of
what the Jacobins were in the year 1793, this person has a right to
speak, both from experience and observation. The worst he can say
of them is, that he was once one of the set. He says that Jacobins
are envious people,—and that envious people, not being able to praise
themselves openly, take an indirect method of doing this, by depreciating
and secretly slandering others. Was it upon this principle that
the reformed Jacobin, Mr. Coleridge (what is bred in the bone will
never come out of the flesh) took such pains, two years ago, to praise
himself by depreciating and canting profound German mysticism
against Mr. Maturin’s successful tragedy of <em>Bertram</em>, which he proved,
being himself in the secret, to be ultra-Jacobinism, and quite different
in its philosophical and poetical tendency from his own sweet injured
<em>Zapolya</em>,—the harbinger of Legitimacy and the Bourbons, which was
offered to Mr. Whitbread for his acceptance, as a piece of ultra-Royalism,
and accordingly rejected by that friend of constitutional
government and the people; but which any one may see represented
to the life at the Royal Circus, accompanied with music, and compressed
into three acts, to make it ‘tedious and brief.’ Or was it
from the remains of the Jacobin leaven in our philosophical poet, that
in a public library at Bristol he endeavoured to advance his own
reputation on the ruins of that of a friend, by that lofty panegyric
which he pronounced on our laurel-honouring laureat:—‘The man
may indeed be a reviewer, but God help him if he fancies himself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>poet?’ And is this the man to talk about the envy of the people
towards hereditary virtue and wisdom, as the cause and root of
Jacobinism? This—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is well for the author of this tragedy that it has been praised
in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>,—or we should not wonder to see Mr.
Coleridge, as well from these lines as from its being acted with
universal applause at the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, set about
proving it to be a very ultra-Jacobinical performance.—But ‘to leave
this keen encounter of the wits, and fall to something of a slower
method.’ The reason—(for Mr. Coleridge knows, that if we have
not ‘reason as plenty as blackberries,’ yet what we have, we are
ready ‘to give to any man without compulsion’)—the reason why
Mr. Coleridge is not what he might be, is, that he would be thought
what he is not. His motto is, to be nothing or every thing. His
levity or his vanity is not satisfied with being admired for what he is,
but for all that he is capable of becoming, wise or foolish, knave or not.
He is not contented to be ‘the inconstant moon,’ unless he can be
the halo round it. He would glitter in the sunshine of public favour,
and yet he would cast no shadow. Please all and please none is his
rule, he has succeeded. He thinks it a great disparagement of his
parts, a proof of a narrow and contracted mind, to be thought to
hold only the sentiments which he professes. His capacious mind
has room for all opinions, both those which he believes and those
which he does not. He thinks he shews the greatest magnanimity
when he shews the greatest contempt for his own principles, past,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>present, and to come. He would be esteemed greatly superior, not
only to the rest of the world, but to himself. Would any one catch
him in the trammels of a sect? Would any one make him swear
to the dogmas of a party? Would any one suppose that he has any
prejudices in favour of his own notions? That he is blindly wedded
to one single view of a subject, as a man is wedded to one wife?
He is shocked at any such imputation of intellectual uxoriousness.
Would the Presbyterians try to hook him in?—he knows better than
Socinus or old John Knox. Would the Established Church receive
him at her wide portals?—he carries too great a weight of the
Fathers and school divinity at his back. Would the Whigs patronise
him?—he is too straitened in antiquated notions and traditional
prejudices. Would the Tories take him in?—he is too liberal,
enlightened, and transcendental for them. Would principle bind
him?—he shuffles out of it, as a clog upon his freedom of thought,
‘his large discourse of reason, looking before and after.’ Would
interest lay dirty hands upon him?—he jockies her too by some fetch
or conundrum, borrowed from the great clerks of the so-called Dark
Ages. You can no more know where to have him than an otter.
You might as well hedge the cuckoo. You see him now squat like
a toad at the ear of the <cite>Courier</cite>; and oh! that we could rouse him
up once more into an archangel’s shape. But what is it to him what
so poor a thing as he himself is, who is sublimely indifferent to all
other things, and who may be looked upon as a terrible petrification
of religion, genius, and the love of liberty. Yet it is too much to
think that he who began his career with two Sonnets to Lord
Stanhope and Mary Wolstonecraft, in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, should
end with slimy, drivelling abuse of Jacobinism and the French
Revolution, in the <cite>Courier</cite>;—that, like some devoted fanatic, he
should seek the praise of martyrdom by mangling his own soul
with a prostituted, unpaid-for pen, and let out his last breath as a
pander to that which would be a falsehood, but that it means
nothing.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The fourth and last canto of <cite>Childe Harold</cite> has disappointed us. It
is a falling off from the three former ones. We have read it carefully
through, but it has left only the same impression on our minds that a
troubled dream does,—as disturbed, as confused, as disjointed, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>harassing, and as unprofitable. It is an indigestion of the mind. It
is the lassitude or feverish tossing and tumbling of the imagination,
after having taken a surfeit of pleasure, and fed upon the fumes of
pride. Childe Harold is a spoiled child of the Muses—and of
Fortune. He looks down upon human life, not more with the
superiority of intellect than with the arrogance of birth. The poet
translates the lord into high sounding and supercilious verse. It is
Agamemnon and Thersites in one person. The common events and
calamities of the world afford matter for the effusions of his spleen,
while they seem resented as affronts to his personal dignity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘And as the soldiers’ bare dead bodies lay,</div>
      <div class='line'>He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</div>
      <div class='line'>To bring a slovenly, unhandsome corse</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>So when ‘the very age and body of the time’ comes between his
Lordship’s speculative notions and hereditary prejudices, he stops the
nose at it, and plays some very fantastic tricks before the public, who
are lookers-on. In general, the idle wants, the naughty airs, the ill
humours and <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, the contempt for others, and disgust at themselves,
common to exalted birth and station, are suffered to corrupt and
stagnate in the blood that inherits them;—they are a disease in the
flesh, an obstinate tumour in the mind, a cloud upon the brow, a
venom that vents itself in hateful looks and peevish words to those
about them; but in this poem and this author they have acquired ‘an
understanding and a tongue,’—are sublimed by imagination, systematised
by sophistry—mount the steps of the Capitol, fulmine over
Greece, and are poured in torrents of abuse on the world. It is
well if the world like it—we are tired of the monotony of his Lordship’s
griefs, of which we can perceive neither beginning nor end.
‘They are begot of nothing, born of nothing.’ He volunteers his
own Pilgrimage,—appoints his own penance,—makes his own confession,—and
all—for nothing. He is in despair, because he has
nothing to complain of—miserable, because he is in want of nothing.
‘He has tasted of all earth’s bliss, both living and loving,’ and therefore
he describes himself as suffering the tortures of the damned.
He is in love with misery, because he has possessed every enjoyment;
and because he has had his will in every thing, is inconsolable because
he cannot have impossibilities. His Lordship, in fact, makes out his
own hard case to be, that he has attained all those objects that the
rest of the world admire; that he has met with none of those disasters
which embitter their lives; and he calls upon us to sympathise with
his griefs and his despair.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>This will never do. It is more intolerable than even Mr. Wordsworth’s
arbitrary egotism and pampered self-sufficiency. <em>He</em> creates
a factitious interest out of nothing: Lord Byron would destroy our
interest in all that is. Mr. Wordsworth, to salve his own self-love,
makes the merest toy of his own mind,—the most insignificant object
he can meet with,—of as much importance as the universe: Lord
Byron would persuade us that the universe itself is not worth his or
our notice; and yet he would expect us to be occupied with him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——‘The man whose eye</div>
      <div class='line'>Is ever on himself doth look on one,</div>
      <div class='line'>The least of Nature’s works, one who might move</div>
      <div class='line'>The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds</div>
      <div class='line'>Unlawful ever.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These lines, written by one of these two poets, might be addressed
to both of them with equal propriety.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Byron, in this the fourth and last Canto of <cite>Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage</cite>, seems to have worn out the glowing fervour of his genius
to a <em>calx</em>, and to have exhausted the intense enthusiasm of his favourite
topics of invective. There is little about himself, historically speaking—there
is no plot, no story, no interest excited, no catastrophe.
The general reflections are connected together merely by the accidental
occurrence of different objects—the Venus of Medici, or the
statue of Pompey,—the Capitol at Rome, or the Bridge of Sighs at
Venice,—Shakespear, and Mrs. Radcliffe,—Bonaparte, and his Lordship
in person,—are brought together as in a phantasmagoria, and
with as little attention to keeping or perspective, as in Hogarth’s
famous print for reversing the laws of vision. The judgements pronounced
are often more dogmatical than profound, and with all their
extravagance of expression, common-place. His Lordship does not
understand the Apollo Belvidere or the Venus de Medicis, any more
than Bonaparte. He cants about the one and against the other, and
in doing the last, cuts his own throat. We are not without hopes
that his friend Mr. Hobhouse will set this matter right in his
‘Historical Illustrations’; and shew that, however it may suit his
Noble Friend’s poetical cross-purposes, politically and practically
speaking, a house divided against itself cannot stand. He first, in
his disdain of modern times, finds nothing to compare with the
grandeur of antiquity but Bonaparte; and then ‘as ’twere in spite of
scorn,’ goes on to disdain this idol, which he had himself gratuitously
set up, in a strain of effeminate and rancorous abuse worthy of Mr.
Wordsworth’s pastoral, place-hunting Muse. Suppose what is here
said of ‘the child and champion of Jacobinism’ to be true, are there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>not venal tongues and venal pens enough to echo it, without his Lordship’s
joining in the cry? Will ‘the High Legitimates, the Holy
Band’ be displeased with these captious efforts to level the object of
their hate to the groveling standard of royalty? Is there not a division
of labour even on Mount Parnassus? The other writers of
prose and verse, who enter the Temple of Fame by Mr. Murray’s
door in Albemarle-street, have their cues. Mr. Southey, for instance,
never sings or says, or dreams of singing or saying, that the Prince
Regent is not so great a man as Julius Cæsar. Why then should
Lord Byron force the comparison between the modern and the
ancient hero? It is because the slaves of power mind the cause they
have to serve, because their own interest is concerned; but the friends
of liberty always sacrifice their cause, which is <em>only</em> the cause of
humanity, to their own spleen, vanity, and self-opinion. The league
between tyrants and slaves is a chain of adamant; the bond between
poets and the people is a rope of sand. Is this a truth, or is it not?
If it is not, let Lord Byron write no more on this subject, which is
beyond his height and his depth. Let him not trample on the
mighty or the fallen! Bonaparte is not Beppo.</p>

<p class='c007'>The versification and style of this poem are as perverse and capricious
as the method or the sentiments. One stanza perpetually runs
on into the next, making the exception the rule, merely because it
properly ends in itself; and there is a strange mixture of stately
phraseology and far-fetched metaphor, with the most affected and
bald simplicity of expression and uncouthness in the rhymes. It is
well his Lordship is born so high, or all Grub street would set him
down as a plebeian for such lines as the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘I lov’d her<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c009'><sup>[46]</sup></a> from my boyhood,’ &#38;c. (stanza 18 and part of 19)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What will the Critics of the Cockney School of Poetry say to
this?—Lie on, and swear that it is high patrician poetry, and of
very noble birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The introductory stanzas are on the same subject, Venice; and
are better.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘I stood in Venice, on the bridge of sighs,’ &#38;c. (stanzas 1, 2, and 3)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The thought expressed in the last stanza, ‘but nature doth not
die,’ is particularly fine, and consolatory to the mind. We prefer the
stanza relating to the tomb of Petrarch, to any others in the poem:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘There is a tomb in Arqua;—rear’d in air,’ &#38;c. (stanzas 30–33)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>The apostrophe to Tasso and to his patron is written with great
force, but in a different spirit:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,’ &#38;c. (stanzas 35–38)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the same strain, and with an alternate mixture of enthusiasm
and spleen, the author pays the tribute of acknowledgement to the
artist of ‘the statue that enchants the world,’ to the shades of Michael
Angelo, Alfieri, ‘the starry Galileo,’ Machiavel, and to the Bard of
Prose, ‘him of the Hundred Tales of Love’—Boccacio.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these recollections the poet proceeds to describe the fall of
the Velino, ‘a hell of waters.’ We cannot say but that we think
his powers better suited to express the human passions than to reflect
the forms of nature. In the present instance, however, the poet has
not invoked the genius of the place in vain: it represents, in some
measure, the workings of his own spirit,—disturbed, restless, labouring,
foaming, sparkling, and now hid in labyrinths and plunging into
the gloom of night. The following description is obscure, tortuous,
perplexed, and abortive; yet who can say that it is not beautiful,
striking, and impassioned?—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in30'>[‘How profound</div>
      <div class='line'>The gulf! and how the giant element,’ &#38;c. (stanzas 70–72)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We’ll look no more: such kind of writing is enough to turn the
brain of the reader or the author. The repetitions in the last stanza
are like interlineations in an imperfect manuscript, left for afterselection;
such as, ‘Hope upon a death-bed’—‘Love watching
madness,’—‘Unworn its steady dies’—‘Serene its brilliant hues,’—‘the
distracted waters’—‘the torture of the scene,’ &#38;c. There is
here in every line an effort at brilliancy, and a successful effort; and
yet, in the next, as if nothing had been done, the same thing is
attempted to be expressed again with the same labour as before, the
same success, and with as little appearance of repose or satisfaction of
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in vain to attempt a regular account of the remainder of this
poem, which is a mass of discordant things, incoherent, not gross,
seen ‘now in glimmer and now in gloom,’ and ‘moving wild laughter
in the throat of death.’ The poem is like the place it describes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The double night of ages, and of her,</div>

      <div class='line'>All round us: we but feel our way to err:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This is undoubtedly fine: but Rome was glorious, before she became
a ruin; stately, before she was laid low; was ‘seen of all eyes,’
before she was confounded in oblivion. Lord Byron’s poetry, in its
irregular and gloomy magnificence, we fear, antedates its own doom;
and is buried in a desolation of his own creating, where the mists of
fancy cloud, instead of lighting up the face of nature; and the fierceness
of the passions, like the Sirocco of the Desart, withers and consumes
the heart. We give this judgment against our wills; and
shall be happy, should we live to see it reversed by another generation.
All our prejudices are in favour of the Noble Poet, and against
his maligners. <cite>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage</cite> is dedicated to Mr. Hobhouse,
and there are passages both in the dedication and the poem
which would bribe our opinions, were they to be bribed either by our
admiration of genius or our love of liberty. Such are the following
passages:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘What from this barren being do we reap,’ &#38;c. (stanzas 93–95)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But we must conclude; not, however, till we have made two
extracts more. We shall not give the passages relating to his separation
from his wife, or the death of the Princess Charlotte: we see
nothing remarkable in the events, or in his Lordship’s reflections on
them. As to his vow of revenge, which is to end in forgiveness, it
is unconscious, constitutional caprice and contradiction: it is self-will
exerting itself in straining at a violent conclusion; and then, by
another exertion, defeating itself by doing nothing. So also he
expatiates on the boundless anticipated glories of a female reign,
which were never likely, and are now impossible, only that he may
rail at lady Fortune in good set terms, and indulge a deeper disgust
at all that is real or possible. We will give what is better than such
cant,—the description of the dying Gladiator, and the conclusion of
the poem:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[‘I see before me the Gladiator lie,’ &#38;c. (stanzas 140 and 141)].</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i><span lang="la">O si sic Omnia!</span></i> All, however, is not so. The stanzas immediately
following, on the story of the Grecian Daughter and the Apollo
Belvidere, are in as false and sophisticated a taste, as these are pure
and sublime. But, at the close of the poem, in addressing the pathless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>ocean,—the self-willed, untamed mighty world of waters,—his
genius resumes its beauty and its power, and the Pilgrim sinks to rest
in strains as mild and placid as the breath of childhood, that frets
itself asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Opera is a fine thing: the only question is, whether it is not too
fine. It is the most fascinating, and at the same time the most
tantalising of all places. It is not the <em>too little</em>, but the <em>too much</em>,
that offends us. Every object is there collected, and displayed in
ostentatious profusion, that can strike the senses or dazzle the
imagination; music, dancing, painting, poetry, architecture, the blaze
of beauty, ‘the glass of fashion, and the mould of form;’ and yet we
are not satisfied—because the multitude and variety of objects distracts
the attention, and by flattering us with a vain shew of the highest
gratification of every faculty and wish, leaves us at last in a state of
listlessness, disappointment, and <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. The powers of the mind are
exhausted, without being invigorated; our expectations are excited,
not satisfied; and we are at some loss to distinguish an excess of
irritation from the height of enjoyment. To sit at the Opera for
a whole evening, is like undergoing the process of animal magnetism
for the same length of time. It is an illusion and a mockery, where
the mind is made ‘the fool of the senses,’ and cheated of itself;
where pleasure after pleasure courts us, as in a fairy palace; where
the Graces and the Muses, waving in a gay, fantastic round with
one another, still turn from our pursuit; where art, like an enchantress
with a thousand faces, still allures our giddy admiration, shifts her
mask, and again disappoints us. The Opera, in short, proceeds
upon a false estimate of taste and morals; it supposes that the
capacity for enjoyment may be multiplied with the objects calculated
to afford it. It is a species of intellectual prostitution; for we can
no more receive pleasure from all our faculties at once than we can
be in love with a number of mistresses at the same time. Though we
have different senses, we have but one heart; and if we attempt to
force it into the service of them all at once, it must grow restive or
torpid, hardened or enervated. The spectator may say to the sister-arts
of Painting, Poetry, and Music, as they advance to him in a
<i><span lang="la">Pas de Trois</span></i> at the Opera, ‘How happy could I be with either, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>t’other dear charmer away;’ but while ‘they all tease him together,’
the heart gives a satisfactory answer to none of them;—is ashamed
of its want of resources to supply the repeated calls upon its sensibility,
seeks relief from the importunity of endless excitement in fastidious
apathy or affected levity; and in the midst of luxury, pomp, vanity,
indolence, and dissipation, feels only the hollow, aching void within,
the irksome craving of unsatisfied desire, because more pleasures are
placed within its reach than it is capable of enjoying, and the interference
of one object with another ends in a double disappointment.
Such is the best account we can give of the nature of the Opera,—of
the contradiction between our expectations of pleasure and our
uneasiness there,—of our very jealousy of the flattering appeals which
are made to our senses, our passions, and our vanity, on all sides,—of
the little relish we acquire for it, and the distaste it gives us for
other things. Any one of the sources of amusement to be found
there would be enough to occupy and keep the attention alive; the
<i><span lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> fatigues and oppresses it. One may be stifled to death
with roses. A head-ache may be produced by a profusion of sweet
smells or of sweet sounds: but we do not like the head-ache the more
on that account. Nor are we reconciled to it, even at the Opera.</p>

<p class='c007'>What makes the difference between an opera of Mozart’s, and the
singing of a thrush confined in a wooden cage at the corner of
the street? The one is nature, and the other is art: the one is
paid for, and the other is not. Madame Fodor sings the air of
<i><span lang="it">Vedrai Carino</span></i> in <cite>Don Giovanni</cite> so divinely, because she was hired
to sing it; she sings it to please the audience, not herself, and does
not always like to be <em>encored</em> in it; but the thrush that awakes at
daybreak with its song, does not sing because it is paid to sing, or
to please others, or to be admired or criticised. It sings because it
is happy: it pours the thrilling sounds from its throat, to relieve the
overflowings of its own heart—the liquid notes come from, and go
to the heart, dropping balm into it, as the gushing spring revives the
traveller’s parched and fainting lips. That stream of joy comes pure
and fresh to the longing sense, free from art and affectation; the same
that rises over vernal groves, mingled with the breath of morning,
and the perfumes of the wild hyacinth, that waits for no audience,
that wants no rehearsing, and still—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hymns its good God, and carols sweet of love.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This is the great difference between nature and art, that the one <em>is</em>
what the other <em>seems</em>, and gives all the pleasure it expresses, because
it feels it itself. Madame Fodor sings, as a musical instrument may
be made to play a tune, and perhaps with no more real delight: but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>it is not so with the linnet or the thrush, that sings because God
pleases, and pours out its little soul in pleasure. This is the reason
why its singing is (so far) so much better than melody or harmony,
than bass or treble, than the Italian or the German school, than
quavers or crotchets, or half-notes, or canzonets, or quartetts, or any
thing in the world but truth and nature!</p>

<p class='c007'>The Opera is the most artificial of all things. It is not only art,
but ostentatious, unambiguous, exclusive art. It does not subsist as
an imitation of nature, but in contempt of it; and instead of seconding,
its object is to pervert and sophisticate all our natural impressions
of things. When the Opera first made its appearance in this country,
there were strong prejudices entertained against it, and it was ridiculed
as a species of the <em>mock-heroic</em>. The prejudices have worn out with
time, and the ridicule has ceased; but the grounds for both remain
the same in the nature of the thing itself. At the theatre, we see
and hear what has been said, thought, and done by various people
elsewhere; at the Opera, we see and hear what was never said,
thought, or done any where but at the Opera. Not only is all communication
with nature cut off, but every appeal to the imagination is
sheathed and softened in the melting medium of Siren sounds. The
ear is cloyed and glutted with warbled ecstacies or agonies; while
every avenue to terror or pity is carefully stopped up and guarded by
song and recitative. Music is not made the vehicle of poetry, but
poetry of music: the very meaning of the words is lost or refined
away in the effeminacy of a foreign language. A grand serious Opera
is a tragedy wrapped up in soothing airs, to suit the tender feelings of
the nurselings of fortune—where tortured victims swoon on beds of
roses, and the pangs of despair sink in tremulous accents into downy
repose. Just so much of human misery is given as to lull those who
are exempted from it into a deeper sense of their own security: just
enough of the picture of human life is shewn to relieve their languor,
without disturbing their indifference;—not to excite their sympathy,
but ‘with some sweet, oblivious antidote,’ to pamper their sleek and
sordid apathy. In a word, the whole business of the Opera is to
stifle emotion in its birth, and to intercept every feeling in its progress
to the heart. Every impression that, left to itself, might sink deep
into the mind, and wake it to real sympathy, is overtaken and baffled
by means of some other impression, plays round the surface of the
imagination, trembles into airy sound, or expires in an empty pageant.
In the grand carnival of the senses,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>the pulse of life is suspended, the link which binds us to humanity is
broken; the soul is fretted by the sense of excessive softness into a
feverish hectic dream; truth becomes a fable, good and evil matters of
perfect indifference, except as they can be made subservient to our
selfish gratification; and there is hardly a vice for which the mind on
coming out of the Opera is not prepared, no virtue of which it is capable!</p>

<p class='c007'>But what shall we say of the company at the Opera? Is it not
grand, select, splendid, and imposing? Do we not see there ‘the
flower of Britain’s warriors, her statesmen, and her fair,’ her nobles
and her diplomatic characters? First, we only know the diplomatic
characters by their taking prodigious quantities of snuff. As to great
warriors, some that we know had better not shew their faces—if
there is any truth in physiognomy; and as to great men, we know
of but one in modern times, and neither Europe nor the Opera-house
was big enough to hold him. With respect to Lords and Ladies, we
see them as we do gilded butterflies in glass cases. We soon get
tired of them, for they seem tired of themselves, and one another.
They gape, stare, affect to whisper, laugh, or talk loud, to fill up
the vacuities of thought and expression. They do not gratify our
predilection for happy faces! But do we not feel the throb of
pleasure from the blaze of beauty in the side-boxes? That blaze
would be brighter, were it not quenched in the sparkling of diamonds.
As for the rest, <em>the grapes are sour</em>. Beauty is a thing that is not
made only to be seen. Who can behold it without a transient wish
to be near it, to adore, to possess it? He must be a fool or a
coxcomb, whom the sight of a beauty dazzles, but does not warm;
whom a thousand glances shot from a thousand heavenly faces pierce
without wounding; who can behold without a pang the bowers of
Paradise opening to him by a thousand doors, and barred against him
by magic spells!—Bright creatures, fairest of the fair, ye shine above
our heads, bright as Ariadne’s crown, fair as the dewy star of
evening: but ye are no more to us! There is no golden chain let
down to us from you: we have sometimes seen you at a play, or
caught a glimpse of your faces passing in a coronet-coach; but——As
we are growing romantic, we shall take a turn into the <em>crush-room</em>,
where, following the train of the great statesmen, the warriors, and
the diplomatic characters, we shall meet with a nearly equal display
of external elegance and accomplishment, without the pride of sex,
rank, or virtue! If the women were all Junos before, here they are
all Venuses, and no less Goddesses! Those who complained of
inaccessible beauty before, may here find beauty more accessible, and
take their revenge on the boxes in the lobbies!</p>

<hr class='c021'>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>In fine, though we do not agree with a contemporary critic, that
the Opera is an entertainment that ought to be held in general estimation,
yet we think the present a very proper time for its encouragement.
It may serve to assist the <i><span lang="fr">euthanasia</span></i> of the British character,
of British liberty, and British morals,—by hardening the heart, while
it softens the senses, and dissolving every manly and generous feeling
in an atmosphere of voluptuous effeminacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question whether Pope was a poet, has hardly yet been settled,
and is hardly worth settling; for if he was not a great poet, he must
have been a great prose writer, that is, he was a great writer of some
sort. He was a man of exquisite faculties, and of the most refined
taste; and as he chose verse (the most obvious distinction of poetry)
as the vehicle to express his ideas, he has generally passed for a poet,
and a good one. If, indeed, by a great poet we mean one who gives
the utmost grandeur to our conceptions of nature, or the utmost force
to the passions of the heart, Pope was not in this sense a great poet;
for the bent, the characteristic power of his mind, lay the contrary
way; namely, in representing things as they appear to the indifferent
observer, stripped of prejudice and passion, as in his critical essays;
or in representing them in the most contemptible and insignificant
point of view, as in his satires; or in clothing the little with
mock-dignity, as in his poems of fancy; or in adorning the trivial
incidents and familiar relations of life with the utmost elegance of
expression, and all the flattering illusions of friendship or self-love, as
in his epistles. He was not then distinguished as a poet of lofty
enthusiasm, of strong imagination, with a passionate sense of the
beauties of nature, or a deep insight into the workings of the heart;
but he was a wit, and a critic, a man of sense, of observation,
and the world; with a keen relish for the elegancies of art, or of
nature when embellished by art, a quick <em>tact</em> for propriety of thought
and manners, as established by the forms and customs of society, a
refined sympathy with the sentiments and habitudes of human life, as
he felt them, within the little circle of his family and friends. He
was, in a word, the poet not of nature but of art: and the distinction
between the two is this. The poet of nature is one who, from the
elements of beauty, of power, and of passion in his own breast,
sympathises with whatever is beautiful, and grand, and impassioned
in nature, in its simple majesty, in its immediate appeal to the senses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>to the thoughts and hearts of all men; so that the poet of nature, by
the truth, and depth, and harmony of his mind, may be said to hold
communion with the very soul of nature; to be identified with, and
to foreknow, and to record the feelings of all men, at all times and
places, as they are liable to the same impressions; and to exert the
same power over the minds of his readers, that nature does. He sees
things in their eternal beauty, for he sees them as they are; he feels
them in their universal interest; for he feels them as they affect the
first principles of his and our common nature. Pope was not
assuredly a poet of this class, or in the first rank of it. He saw
nature only dressed by art; he judged of beauty by fashion; he
sought for truth in the opinions of the world; he judged of the
feelings of others by his own. The capacious soul of Shakespeare
had an intuitive and mighty sympathy with whatever could enter
into the heart of man in all possible circumstances; Pope had an
exact knowledge of all that he himself loved or hated, wished or
wanted. Milton has winged his daring flight from heaven to earth
through chaos and old night. Pope’s muse never wandered with
safety but from his library to his grotto, or from his grotto into his
library again. His mind dwelt with greater pleasure on his own
garden, than on the garden of Eden; he could describe the faultless
whole-length mirror that reflected his own person better than the
smooth surface of the lake that reflects the face of heaven; a piece
of cut glass, or a pair of paste buckles with more brilliance and
effect than a thousand dew-drops glittering in the sun. He would
be more delighted with a patent lamp than with ‘the pale reflex of
Cynthia’s brow,’ that fills the skies with its soft silent lustre, trembles
through the cottage casement, and cheers the watchful mariner on the
lonely wave. In short, he was the poet of personality and of
polished life. That which was nearest to him was the greatest: the
fashion of the day bore sway in his mind over the immutable laws of
nature. He preferred the artificial to the natural in external objects,
because he had a stronger fellow-feeling with the self-love of the
maker or proprietor of a gewgaw than admiration of that which was
interesting to all mankind alike. He preferred the artificial to the
natural in passion, because the involuntary and uncalculating impulses
of the one hurried him away with a force and vehemence with which
he could not grapple, while he could trifle with the conventional and
superficial modifications of mere sentiment at will, laugh at or admire,
put them on or off like a masquerade dress, make much or little of
them, indulge them for a longer or a shorter time as he pleased, and
because, while they amused his fancy and exercised his ingenuity,
they never once disturbed his vanity, his levity, or indifference. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>mind was the antithesis of strength and grandeur: its power was the
power of indifference. He had none of the inspired raptures of
poetry: he was in poetry what the sceptic is in religion. It cannot
be denied that his chief excellence lay more in diminishing than ‘in
aggrandizing objects,—in checking than in encouraging our enthusiasm,—in
sneering at the extravagancies of fancy or passion, instead of
giving a loose to them,—in describing a row of pins and needles
rather than the embattled spears of Greeks and Trojans,—in penning
a lampoon or a compliment,—and in praising Martha Blount!</p>

<p class='c007'>Shakespeare says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In fortune’s ray and brightness</div>
      <div class='line'>The herd hath more annoyance by the brize</div>
      <div class='line'>Than by the tyger: But when the splitting wind</div>
      <div class='line'>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And flies fled under shade, why then</div>
      <div class='line'>The thing of courage,</div>
      <div class='line'>As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathize,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with an accent tuned i’ th’ self-same key,</div>
      <div class='line'>Replies to chiding fortune.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There is hardly any of this rough work in Pope. His muse was
on a peace establishment, and grew somewhat effeminate by long ease
and indulgence. He lived in the smiles of fortune, and basked in
the favour of the great. In his smooth and polished verse we meet
with no prodigies of nature, but with miracles of wit; the thunders
of his pen are whispered flatteries; his forked lightnings playful
sarcasms; for the ‘gnarled oak’ he gives us ‘the soft myrtle’; for
rocks, and seas, and mountains, artificial grass-plats, gravel-walks, and
tinkling rills; for earthquakes and tempests, the breaking of a flower-pot,
or the fall of a china-jar; for the tug and war of the elements,
or the deadly strife of the passions, we have</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Calm contemplation and poetic ease.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Yet within this retired and narrow circle, how much, and that how
exquisite, was contained! What discrimination, what wit, what
delicacy, what fancy, what lurking spleen, what elegance of thought,
what refinement of sentiment! It is like looking at the world through
a microscope, where every thing assumes a new character and a new
consequence,—where things are seen in their minutest circumstances
and slightest shades of difference,—when the little becomes gigantic,
the deformed beautiful, and the beautiful deformed. The wrong end
of the magnifier is, to be sure, held to every thing; but still the
exhibition is highly curious, and we know not whether to be most
pleased or surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is not any term that is oftener misapplied, or that is a stronger
instance of the abuse of language, than this same word, <em>respectable</em>.
By a <em>respectable man</em> is generally meant a person whom there is no
reason for respecting, or none that we choose to name: for if there
is any good reason for the opinion we wish to express, we naturally
assign it as the ground of his respectability. If the person whom you
are desirous to characterize favourably, is distinguished for his good-nature,
you say that he is a good-natured man; if by his zeal to serve
his friends, you call him a friendly man; if by his wit or sense, you
say that he is witty or sensible; if by his honesty or learning, you
say so at once; but if he is none of these, and there is no one quality
which you can bring forward to justify the high opinion you would
be thought to entertain of him, you then take the question for granted,
and jump at a conclusion, by observing gravely, that ‘he is a very
respectable man.’ It is clear, indeed, that where we have any striking
and generally admitted reasons for respecting a man, the most
obvious way to ensure the respect of others, will be to mention his
estimable qualities; where these are wanting, the wisest course must
be to say nothing about them, but to insist on the general inference
which we have our particular reasons for drawing, only vouching for
its authenticity. If, for instance, the only motive we have for thinking
or speaking well of another is, that he gives us good dinners, as
this is not a valid reason to those who do not, like us, partake of his
hospitality, we may (without going into particulars) content ourselves
with assuring them, that he is a most respectable man: if he is a slave
to those above him, and an oppressor of those below him, but sometimes
makes us the channels of his bounty or the tools of his caprice,
it may be as well to say nothing of the matter, but to confine ourselves
to the safer generality, that he is a person of the highest respectability:
if he is a low dirty fellow, who has amassed an immense fortune,
which he does not know what to do with, the possession of it alone
will guarantee his respectability, if we say nothing of the manner in
which he has come by it, or in which he spends it. A man may be
a knave or a fool, or both (as it may happen), and yet be a most
respectable man, in the common and authorized sense of the term,
provided he keeps up appearances, and does not give common fame a
handle for no longer keeping up the imposture. The best title to the
character of respectability lies in the convenience of those who echo
the cheat, and in the conventional hypocrisy of the world. Any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>may lay claim to it who is willing to give himself airs of importance,
and can find means to divert others from inquiring too strictly into
his pretensions. It is a disposable commodity,—not a part of the
man, that sticks to him like his skin, but an appurtenance, like his
goods and chattels. It is meat, drink, and clothing to those who
take the benefit of it by allowing others the credit. It is the current
coin, the circulating medium, in which the fictitious intercourse of the
world is carried on, the bribe which interest pays to vanity. Respectability
includes all that vague and indefinable mass of respect floating
in the world, which arises from sinister motives in the person who
pays it, and is offered to adventitious and doubtful qualities in the
person who receives it. It is spurious and nominal; hollow and
venal. To suppose that it is to be taken literally or applied to sterling
merit, would betray the greatest ignorance of the customary use of
speech. When we hear the word coupled with the name of any
individual, it would argue a degree of romantic simplicity to imagine
that it implies any one quality of head or heart, any one excellence
of body or mind, any one good action or praiseworthy sentiment; but
as soon as it is mentioned, it conjures up the ideas of a handsome
house with large acres round it, a sumptuous table, a cellar well
stocked with excellent wines, splendid furniture, a fashionable equipage,
with a long list of elegant contingencies. It is not what a man
<em>is</em>, but what he <em>has</em>, that we speak of in the significant use of this
term. He may be the poorest creature in the world in himself, but
if he is well to do, and can spare some of his superfluities, if he can
lend us his purse or his countenance upon occasion, he then ‘buys
golden opinions’ of us;—it is but fit that we should speak well of the
bridge that carries us over, and in return for what we can get from
him, we embody our servile gratitude, hopes, and fears, in this word
respectability. By it we pamper his pride, and feed our own
necessities. It must needs be a very honest uncorrupted word that is
the go-between in this disinterested kind of traffic. We do not think
of applying this word to a great poet or a great painter, to the man of
genius or the man of virtue, for it is seldom we can <em>spunge</em> upon them.
It would be a solecism for any one to pretend to the character who
has a shabby coat to his back, who goes without a dinner, or has not
a good house over his head. He who has reduced himself in the
world by devoting himself to a particular study, or adhering to a
particular cause, excites only a smile of pity, or a shrug of the
shoulders at the mention of his name; while he who has raised himself
in it by a different course, who has become rich for want of ideas,
and powerful from want of principle, is looked up to with silent
homage, and passes for a respectable man. ‘The learned pate ducks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>to the golden fool.’ We spurn at virtue and genius in rags; and lick
the dust in the presence of vice and folly in purple. When Otway
was left to starve after having produced <cite>Venice Preserv’d</cite>, there was
nothing in the phrenzied action with which he devoured the food that
choked him, to provoke the respect of the mob, who would have
hooted at him the more for knowing that he was a poet. Spenser,
kept waiting for the hundred pounds which Burleigh grudged him
‘for a song,’ might feel the mortification of his situation; but the
statesman never felt any diminution of his sovereign’s favour in consequence
of it. Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>’s neglect of his favourite poet Butler did
not make him look less gracious in the eyes of his courtiers, or of the
wits and critics of the time. Burns’s embarrassments, and the
temptations to which he was exposed by his situation, degraded him,
but left no stigma on his patrons, who still meet to celebrate his
memory, and consult about his monument, in the face of day. To
enrich the mind of a country by works of art or science, and leave
yourself poor, is not the way for any one to rank as respectable, at
least in his lifetime:—to oppress, to enslave, to cheat, and plunder it,
is a much better way. ‘The time gives evidence of it.’ But the
instances are common.</p>

<p class='c007'>Respectability means a man’s situation and success in life, not his
character or conduct. The city merchant never loses his respectability
till he becomes bankrupt. After that, we hear no more of it
or him. The justice of the peace, and the parson of the parish, the
lord and the squire, are allowed, by immemorial usage, to be very
respectable people, though no one ever thinks of asking why. They
are a sort of fixtures in this way. To take an example from one of
them. The country parson may pass his whole time, when he is not
employed in the cure of souls, in flattering his rich neighbours, and
leaguing with them to <em>snub</em> his poor ones, in seizing poachers, and
encouraging informers; he may be exorbitant in exacting his tithes,
harsh to his servants, the dread and bye-word of the village where he
resides, and yet all this, though it may be notorious, shall abate
nothing of his respectability. It will not hinder his patron from
giving him another living to play the petty tyrant in, or prevent him
from riding over to the squire’s in his carriage and being well received,
or from sitting on the bench of justices with due decorum and with
clerical dignity. The poor curate, in the mean time, who may be
a real comfort to the bodies and minds of his parishioners, will be
passed by without notice. Parson Adams, drinking his ale in Sir
Thomas Booby’s kitchen, makes no very respectable figure; but Sir
Thomas himself was right worshipful, and his widow a person of
honour! A few such historiographers as Fielding would put an end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>to the farce of respectability, with others like it. Peter Pounce, in
the same author, was a consummation of this character, translated into
the most vulgar English. The character of Captain Blifil, his
epitaph, and funeral sermon, are worth tomes of casuistry, and patched
up theories of moral sentiments. Pope somewhere exclaims, in his
fine indignant way,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What can ennoble sots, or knaves, or cowards?</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But this is the heraldry of poets, not of the world. In fact, the
only way for a poet now-a-days to emerge from the obscurity of
poverty and genius, is to prostitute his pen, turn literary pimp to
some borough-mongering lord, canvass for him at elections, and by
this means aspire to the same importance, and be admitted on the
same respectable footing with him as his valet, his steward, or his
practising attorney. A Jew, a stock-jobber, a war contractor, a
successful monopolist, a nabob, an Indian director, or an African
slave-dealer, are all very respectable people in their turn. A member
of parliament is not only respectable, but <em>honourable</em>;—‘all honourable
men!’ Yet this circumstance, which implies such a world of respect,
really means nothing. To say of any one that he is a member of
parliament, is to say, at the same time, that he is not at all distinguished
as such. No body ever thought of telling you, that
Mr. Fox or Mr. Pitt were members of parliament. Such is the
constant difference between names and things!</p>

<p class='c007'>The most mischievous and offensive use of this word has been in
politics. By respectable people (in the fashionable cant of the day)
are meant those who have not a particle of regard for any one but
themselves, who have feathered their own nests, and only want to lie
snug and warm in them. They have been set up and appealed to as
the only friends of their country and the constitution, while in truth
they were friends to nothing but their own interest. With them all
is well, if they are well off. They are raised by their lucky stars
above the reach of the distresses of the community, and are cut off
by their situation and sentiments, from any sympathy with their kind.
They would see their country ruined before they would part with the
least of their superfluities. Pampered in luxury and their own selfish
comforts, they are proof against the calls of patriotism, and the cries
of humanity. They would not get a scratch with a pin to save the
universe. They are more affected by the overturning of a plate of
turtle soup than by the starving of a whole county. The most
desperate characters, picked up from the most necessitous and
depraved classes, are not worse judges of politics than your true,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>staunch, thorough-paced ‘lives and fortunes men,’ who have what is
called a stake in the country, and see every thing through the medium
of their cowardly and unprincipled hopes and fears. London is,
perhaps, the only place in which the standard of respectability at all
varies from the standard of money. There things go as much by
appearance as by weight; and he may be said to be a respectable
man who cuts a certain figure in company by being dressed in the
fashion, and venting a number of common-place things with tolerable
grace and fluency. If a person there brings a certain share of
information and good manners into mixed society, it is not asked,
when he leaves it, whether he is rich or not. Lords and fiddlers,
authors and common council men, editors of newspapers and
parliamentary speakers, meet together, and the difference is not so
much marked as one would suppose. To be an Edinburgh Reviewer
is, I suspect, the highest rank in modern literary society.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fashion is an odd jumble of contradictions, of sympathies and antipathies.
It exists only by its being participated among a certain
number of persons, and its essence is destroyed by being communicated
to a greater number. It is a continual struggle between ‘the great
vulgar and the small’ to get the start of or keep up with each other
in the race of appearances, by an adoption on the part of the one of
such external and fantastic symbols as strike the attention and excite
the envy or admiration of the beholder, and which are no sooner
made known and exposed to public view for this purpose, than they
are successfully copied by the multitude, the slavish herd of imitators,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>who do not wish to be behind-hand with their betters in outward
show and pretensions, and which then sink, without any farther
notice, into disrepute and contempt. Thus fashion lives only in a
perpetual round of giddy innovation and restless vanity. To be old-fashioned
is the greatest crime a coat or a hat can be guilty of. To
look like nobody else is a sufficiently mortifying reflection; to be in
danger of being mistaken for one of the rabble is worse. Fashion
constantly begins and ends in the two things it abhors most, singularity
and vulgarity. It is the perpetual setting up and disowning a certain
standard of taste, elegance, and refinement, which has no other
foundation or authority than that it is the prevailing distinction of
the moment, which was yesterday ridiculous from its being new,
and to-morrow will be odious from its being common. It is one of
the most slight and insignificant of all things. It cannot be lasting,
for it depends on the constant change and shifting of its own harlequin
disguises; it cannot be sterling, for, if it were, it could not depend
on the breath of caprice; it must be superficial, to produce its immediate
effect on the gaping crowd; and frivolous, to admit of its
being assumed at pleasure by the numbers of those who affect, by
being in the fashion, to be distinguished from the rest of the world.
It is not any thing in itself, nor the sign of any thing but the folly and
vanity of those who rely upon it as their greatest pride and ornament.
It takes the firmest hold of the most flimsy and narrow minds, of
those whose emptiness conceives of nothing excellent but what is
thought so by others, and whose self-conceit makes them willing to
confine the opinion of all excellence to themselves and those like
them. That which is true or beautiful in itself, is not the less so for
standing alone. That which is good for any thing, is the better for
being more widely diffused. But fashion is the abortive issue of vain
ostentation and exclusive egotism: it is haughty, trifling, affected,
servile, despotic, mean, and ambitious, precise and fantastical, all in a
breath—tied to no rule, and bound to conform to every whim of the
minute. ‘The fashion of an hour old mocks the wearer.’ It is
a sublimated essence of levity, caprice, vanity, extravagance, idleness,
and selfishness. It thinks of nothing but not being contaminated
by vulgar use, and winds and doubles like a hare, and betakes
itself to the most paltry shifts to avoid being overtaken by the
common hunt that are always in full chase after it. It contrives
to keep up its fastidious pretensions, not by the difficulty of the
attainment, but by the rapidity and evanescent nature of the changes.
It is a sort of conventional badge, or understood passport into select
circles, which must still be varying (like the water-mark in bank-notes)
not to be counterfeited by those without the pale of fashionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>society; for to make the test of admission to all the privileges of
that refined and volatile atmosphere depend on any real merit or
extraordinary accomplishment, would exclude too many of the pert,
the dull, the ignorant, too many shallow, upstart, and self-admiring
pretenders, to enable the few that passed muster to keep one another
in any tolerable countenance. If it were the fashion, for instance, to
be distinguished for virtue, it would be difficult to set or follow the
example; but then this would confine the pretension to a small
number, (not the most fashionable part of the community), and would
carry a very singular air with it. Or if excellence in any art or
science were made the standard of fashion, this would also effectually
prevent vulgar imitation, but then it would equally prevent fashionable
impertinence. There would be an obscure circle of <i><span lang="it">virtù</span></i> as well as
virtue, drawn within the established circle of fashion, a little province
of a mighty empire;—the example of honesty would spread slowly,
and learning would still have to boast of a respectable minority. But
of what use would such uncourtly and out-of-the-way accomplishments
be to the great and noble, the rich and the fair, without any of the
<em>eclat</em>, the noise and nonsense which belong to that which is followed
and admired by all the world alike? The real and solid will never
do for the current coin, the common wear and tear of foppery, and
fashion. It must be the meretricious, the showy, the outwardly fine,
and intrinsically worthless—that which lies within the reach of the
most indolent affectation, that which can be put on or off at the
suggestion of the most wilful caprice, and for which, through all its
fluctuations, no mortal reason can be given, but that it is the newest
absurdity in vogue! The shape of a head-dress, whether flat or
piled (curl on curl) several stories high by the help of pins and
pomatum, the size of a pair of paste buckles, the quantity of gold-lace
on an embroidered waistcoat, the mode of taking a pinch of
snuff, or of pulling out a pocket-handkerchief, the lisping and affected
pronunciation of certain words, the saying <em>Me’m</em> for <em>Madam</em>, Lord
Foppington’s <em>Tam and ’Paun honour</em>, with a regular set of visiting
phrases and insipid sentiments ready sorted for the day, were what
formerly distinguished the mob of fine gentlemen and ladies from the
mob of their inferiors. These marks and appendages of gentility
had their day, and were then discarded for others equally peremptory
and unequivocal. But in all this chopping and changing, it is
generally one folly that drives out another; one trifle that by its
specific levity acquires a momentary and surprising ascendency over
the last. There is no striking deformity of appearance or behaviour
that has not been made ‘the sign of an inward and invisible grace.’
Accidental imperfections are laid hold of to hide real defects. Paint,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>patches, and powder, were at one time synonymous with health,
cleanliness, and beauty. Obscenity, irreligion, small oaths, tippling,
gaming, effeminacy in the one sex and Amazon airs in the other,
any thing is the fashion while it lasts. In the reign of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>,
the profession and practice of every species of extravagance and
debauchery were looked upon as the indispensable marks of an accomplished
cavalier. Since that period the court has reformed, and has
had rather a rustic air. Our belles formerly overloaded themselves
with dress: of late years, they have affected to go almost naked,—‘and
are, when unadorned, adorned the most.’ The women having
left off stays, the men have taken to wear them, if we are to believe
the authentic Memoirs of the Fudge Family. The Niobe head is at
present buried in the <em>poke</em> bonnet, and the French milliners and
<i><span lang="fr">marchands des modes</span></i> have proved themselves an overmatch for the
Greek sculptors, in matters of taste and costume.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very striking change has, however, taken place in dress of late
years, and some progress has been made in taste and elegance, from
the very circumstance, that, as fashion has extended its empire in that
direction, it has lost its power. While fashion in dress included
what was costly, it was confined to the wealthier classes: even this
was an encroachment on the privileges of rank and birth, which for
a long time were the only things that commanded or pretended to
command respect, and we find Shakespear complaining that ‘the city
madam bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders;’ but, when
the appearing in the top of the mode no longer depended on the
power of purchasing certain expensive articles of dress, or the right
of wearing them, the rest was so obvious and easy, that any one who
chose might cut as coxcombical a figure as the best. It became
a matter of mere affectation on the one side, and gradually ceased to
be made a matter of aristocratic assumption on the other. ‘In the
grand carnival of this our age,’ among other changes this is not the
least remarkable, that the monstrous pretensions to distinctions in
dress have dwindled away by tacit consent, and the simplest and most
graceful have been in the same request with all classes. In this
respect, as well as some others, ‘the age is grown so picked, the
peasant’s toe comes so near the courtier’s heel, it galls his
kibe;’ a lord is hardly to be distinguished in the street from an
attorney’s clerk; and a plume of feathers is no longer mistaken for
the highest distinction in the land! The ideas of natural equality
and the Manchester steam-engines together have, like a double
battery, levelled the high towers and artificial structures of fashion in
dress, and a white muslin gown is now the common costume of the
mistress and the maid, instead of their wearing, as heretofore, rich silks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>and satins or coarse linsey-wolsey. It would be ridiculous (on a
similar principle) for the courtier to take the wall of the citizen,
without having a sword by his side to maintain his right of precedence;
and, from the stricter notions that have prevailed of a man’s
personal merit and identity, a cane dangling from his arm is the
greatest extension of his figure that can be allowed to the modern
<i><span lang="fr">petit-maître</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>What shews the worthlessness of mere fashion is, to see how easily
this vain and boasted distinction is assumed, when the restraints of
decency or circumstances are once removed, by the most uninformed
and commonest of the people. I know an undertaker that is the
greatest prig in the streets of London, and an Aldermanbury haberdasher,
that has the most military strut of any lounger in Bond-street
or St. James’s. We may, at any time, raise a regiment of fops from
the same number of fools, who have vanity enough to be intoxicated
with the smartness of their appearance, and not sense enough to be
ashamed of themselves. Every one remembers the story in Peregrine
Pickle, of the strolling gipsy that he picked up in spite, had well
scoured, and introduced her into genteel company, where she met
with great applause, till she got into a passion by seeing a fine lady
cheat at cards, rapped out a volley of oaths, and let nature get the
better of art. Dress is the great secret of address. Clothes and
confidence will set anybody up in the trade of modish accomplishment.
Look at the two classes of well-dressed females whom we
see at the play-house, in the boxes. Both are equally dressed in the
height of the fashion, both are <em>rouged</em>, and wear their neck and arms
bare,—both have the same conscious, haughty, theatrical air;—the
same toss of the head, the same stoop in the shoulders, with all the
grace that arises from a perfect freedom from embarrassment, and all
the fascination that arises from a systematic disdain of formal prudery,—the
same pretence and jargon of fashionable conversation,—the
same mimicry of tones and phrases,—the same ‘lisping, and ambling,
and painting, and nicknaming of Heaven’s creatures;’ the same
every thing but real propriety of behaviour, and real refinement of
sentiment. In all the externals, they are as like as the reflection
in the looking-glass. The only difference between the woman of
fashion and the woman of pleasure is, that the one <em>is</em> what the other
only <em>seems to be</em>; and yet, the victims of dissipation who thus rival
and almost outshine women of the first quality in all the blaze, and
pride, and glitter of shew and fashion, are, in general, no better than
a set of raw, uneducated, inexperienced country girls, or awkward,
coarse-fisted servant maids, who require no other apprenticeship or
qualification to be on a level with persons of the highest distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>in society, in all the brilliancy and elegance of outward appearance,
than that they have forfeited its common privileges, and every title
to respect in reality. The truth is, that real virtue, beauty, or understanding,
are the same, whether ‘in a high or low degree;’ and the
airs and graces of pretended superiority over these which the highest
classes give themselves, from mere frivolous and external accomplishments,
are easily imitated, with provoking success, by the lowest,
whenever they <em>dare</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two nearest things in the world are gentility and vulgarity—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And thin partitions do their bounds divide.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Where there is much affectation of the one, we may be always
sure of meeting with a double share of the other. Those who are
conscious to themselves of any real superiority or refinement, are not
particularly jealous of the adventitious marks of it. Miss Burney’s
novels all turn upon this slender distinction. It is the only thing
that can be said against them. It is hard to say which she has made
out to be the worst; low people always aping gentility, or people in
high life always avoiding vulgarity. Mr. Smith and the Brangtons
were everlastingly trying to do as their fashionable acquaintances did,
and these again were always endeavouring <em>not</em> to do and say what
Mr. Smith and the Brangtons did or said. What an instructive
game at cross-purposes! ‘Kings are naturally lovers of low company,’
according to the observation of Mr. Burke; because their rank cannot
be called into question by it, and they can only hope to find, in the
opposite extreme of natural and artificial inequality, any thing to
confirm them in the belief, that their personal pretensions at all answer
to the ostensible superiority to which they are raised. By associating
only with the worst and weakest, they persuade themselves that they
are the best and wisest of mankind.</p>

<p class='c016'>This is a more important subject than it seems at first sight. It is
as serious in its results as it is contemptible in the means by which
those results are brought about. Nicknames for the most part govern
the world. The history of politics, of religion, of literature, of
morals, and of private life, is too often little less than the history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>of nicknames. What are half the convulsions of the civilised world,
the frequent overthrow of states and kingdoms, the shock and hostile
encounter of mighty continents, the battles by sea and land, the
intestine commotions, the feuds of the Vitelli and Orsini, of the
Guelphs and Gibellines, the civil wars in England, and the League
in France, the jealousies and heart-burnings of cabinets and councils,
the uncharitable proscriptions of creeds and sects, Turk, Jew, Pagan,
Papist and Puritan, Quaker and Methodist,—the persecutions and
massacres, the burnings, tortures, imprisonments, and lingering deaths
inflicted for a different profession of faith,—but so many illustrations
of the power of this principle? Fox’s Book of Martyrs, and Neale’s
History of the Puritans, are comments on the same text. The fires
in Smithfield were fanned by nicknames, and a nickname set its seal
on the unopened dungeons of the Holy Inquisition. Nicknames are
the talismans and spells that collect and set in motion all the combustible
part of men’s passions and prejudices, which have hitherto played
so much more successful a game, and done their work so much more
effectually than reason, in all the grand concerns and petty details of
human life, and do not yet seem tired of the task assigned them.
Nicknames are the convenient portable tools by which they simplify
the process of mischief, and get through their job with the least time
and trouble. These worthless, unmeaning, irritating, envenomed
words of reproach are the established signs by which the different
compartments of society are ticketted, labelled, and marked out for
each other’s hatred and contempt. They are to be had, ready cut
and dry, of all sorts and sizes, wholesale and retail, for foreign
exportation or home consumption, and for all occasions in life. ‘The
priest calls the lawyer a cheat, the lawyer beknaves the divine.’ The
Frenchman hates the Englishman because he is an Englishman, and
the Englishman hates the Frenchman for as good a reason. The
Whig hates the Tory, and the Tory the Whig. The Dissenter hates
the Church-of-England-man, and the Church-of-England-man hates
the Dissenter, as if they were of a different species, because they
have a different designation. The Mussulman calls the worshipper
of the Cross ‘Christian dog,’ spits in his face, and kicks him from
the pavement, by virtue of a nickname; and the Papist retorts the
indignity upon the Infidel and the Jew by the same infallible rule of
right. In France, they damn Shakespear in the lump, by calling him
a <em>barbare</em>; and we talk of Racine’s <em>verbiage</em> with inexpressible
contempt and self-complacency. Among ourselves, an anti-Jacobin
critic denounces a Jacobin poet and his friends, at a venture, ‘as
infidels and fugitives, who have left their wives destitute, and their
children fatherless’—whether they have wives and children or not.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>The unenlightened savage makes a meal of his enemy’s flesh, after
reproaching him with the name of his tribe, because he is differently
tattooed; and the literary cannibal cuts up the character of his
opponent by the help of a nickname. The jest of all this is, that
a party nickname is always a relative term, and has its counter-sign,
which has just the same force and meaning, so that both must be
perfectly ridiculous and insignificant. A Whig implies a Tory;
there must be ‘Malcontents’ as well as ‘Malignants’; Jacobins and
Anti-Jacobins; French and English. These sort of <i><span lang="fr">noms des guerres</span></i>
derive all their force from their contraries. Take away the meaning
of the one, and you take the sting out of the other. They could not
exist but upon the strength of mutual and irreconcileable antipathies;
there must be no love lost between them. What is there in the
names themselves to give them a preference over each other?
‘Sound them, they do become the mouth as well; weigh them, they
are as heavy; conjure with them, one will raise a spirit as soon as
the other.’ If there were not fools and madmen who hated both,
there could not be fools and madmen bigotted to either. I have
heard an eminent character boast that he had done more to produce
the late war by nicknaming Buonaparte ‘the Corsican,’ than all the
state-papers and documents on the subject put together. And yet
Mr. Southey asks triumphantly, ‘Is it to be supposed that it is
England, <em>our</em> England, to whom that war was owing?’ As if, in a
dispute between two countries, the conclusive argument which lies in
the pronoun <em>our</em>, belonged only to one of them. I like Shakespear’s
version of the matter better:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hath Britain all the sun that shines? day, night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are they not but in Britain? I’ th’ world’s volume</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Our</em> Britain seems as of it, but not in it;</div>
      <div class='line'>In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee think</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s livers out of Britain.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In all national disputes, it is common to appeal to the numbers on
your side as decisive on the point. If every body in England thought
the late war right, every body in France thought it wrong. There
were ten millions on one side of the question, (or rather of the water),
and thirty millions on the other side. That’s all. I remember some
one arguing, in justification of our ministers interfering on that occasion,
‘That governments would not go to war for nothing;’ to which
I answered, Then they could not go to war at all, for, at that rate,
neither of them could be in the wrong, and yet both of them must be
in the right, which was absurd. The only meaning of these vulgar
nicknames and party-distinctions, where they are urged most violently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>and confidently, is, that others differ from you in some particular
or other, (whether it be opinion, dress, clime, complexion), which
you highly disapprove of, forgetting, that, by the same rule, they have
the very same right to be offended at you because you differ from
them. Those who have reason on their side do not make the most
obstinate and furious appeals to prejudice and abusive language. I
know but of one exception to this general rule, and that is, where the
things that excite disgust are of such a kind that they cannot well be
gone into without offence to decency and good manners; but it is
equally certain in this case, that those who are most shocked at the
things are not those who are most forward to apply the names. A
person will not be fond of repeating a charge, or adverting to a subject,
that inflicts a wound on his own feelings, even for the sake of
wounding the feelings of another. A man should be very sure that
he himself is not what he has always in his mouth. The greatest
prudes have been often accounted the greatest hypocrites, and a satirist
is at best but a suspicious character. The loudest and most unblushing
invectives against vice and debauchery will as often proceed from
a desire to inflame and pamper the passions of the writer, by raking
into a nauseous subject, as from a wish to excite virtuous indignation
against it in the public mind, or to reform the individual. To
familiarise the mind to gross ideas is not the way to increase your
own or the general repugnance to them. But, to return to the subject
of nicknames.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of this figure of speech is, that it excites a strong idea
without requiring any proof. It is a shorthand compendious mode of
getting at a conclusion, and never troubling yourself or any body else
with the formalities of reasoning or the dictates of common sense. It
is superior to all evidence, for it does not rest upon any, and operates
with the greatest force and certainty in proportion to the utter want
of probability. Belief is only a strong impression, and the malignity
or extravagance of the accusation passes for a proof of the crime.
‘Brevity is the soul of wit;’ and of all eloquence a nickname is the
most concise, and of all arguments the most unanswerable. It gives
<i><span lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> to the imagination, throws the reins on the neck of the
passions, and suspends the use of the understanding altogether. It does
not stand upon ceremony, on the nice distinctions of right and wrong.
It does not wait the slow processes of reason, or stop to unravel the
web of sophistry. It takes every thing for granted that serves for
nourishment for the spleen. It is instantaneous in its operations.
There is nothing to interpose between the effect and it. It is passion
without proof, and action without thought,—‘the unbought grace of
life, the cheap defence of nations.’ It does not, as Mr. Burke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>expresses it, ‘leave the will puzzled, undecided, and sceptical in the
moment of action.’ It is a word and a blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ‘No Popery’ cry, raised a little while ago, let loose all the
lurking spite and prejudice which had lain rankling in the proper
receptacles for them for above a century, without any knowledge of
the past history of the country which had given rise to them, or any
reference to their connection with present circumstances; for the
knowledge of the one would have prevented the possibility of their
application to the other. Facts present a tangible and definite idea
to the mind, a train of causes and consequences, accounting for each
other, and leading to a positive conclusion—but no farther. But a
nickname is tied down to no such limited service; it is a disposable
force, that is almost always perverted to mischief. It clothes itself
with all the terrors of uncertain abstraction, and there is no end of the
abuse to which it is liable but the cunning of those who employ, or
the credulity of those who are gulled by it. It is a reserve of the
ignorance, bigotry, and intolerance of weak and vulgar minds, brought
up where reason fails, and always ready, at a moment’s warning, to
be applied to any, the most absurd purposes. If you bring specific
charges against a man, you thereby enable him to meet and repel
them, if he thinks it worth his while; but a nickname baffles reply,
by the very vagueness of the inferences from it, and gives increased
activity to the confused, dim, and imperfect notions of dislike connected
with it, from their having no settled ground to rest upon.
The mind naturally irritates itself against an unknown object of fear
or jealousy, and makes up for the blindness of its zeal by an excess
of it. We are eager to indulge our hasty feelings to the utmost, lest,
by stopping to examine, we should find that there is no excuse for
them. The very consciousness of the injustice we may be doing
another makes us only the more loud and bitter in our invectives
against him. We keep down the admonitions of returning reason,
by calling up a double portion of gratuitous and vulgar spite. The
will may be said to act with most force <i><span lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>; the passions are
the most ungovernable when they are blindfolded. That malignity
is always the most implacable which is accompanied with a sense of
weakness, because it is never satisfied of its own success or safety.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>A nickname carries the weight of the pride, the indolence, the
cowardice, the ignorance, and the ill-nature of mankind on its side.
It acts, by mechanical sympathy, on the nerves of society. Any one
who is without character himself may make himself master of the
reputation of another by the application of a nickname, as, if you do
not mind soiling your fingers, you may always throw dirt on another.
No matter how undeserved the imputation, it will stick; for, though
it is sport to the bye-standers to see you bespattered, they will not
stop to see you wipe out the stains. You are not heard in your own
defence; it has no effect, it does not tell, excites no sensation, or it
is only felt as a disappointment of their triumph over you. Their
passions and prejudices are inflamed by the charge, ‘as rage with rage
doth sympathise;’ by vindicating yourself, you merely bring them
back to common sense, which is a very sober, mawkish state. <em>Give
a dog a bad name, and hang him</em>, is a proverb. ‘A nickname is the
heaviest stone that the devil can throw at a man.’ It is a bugbear to
the imagination, and, though we do not believe it, it still haunts our
apprehensions. Let a nickname be industriously applied to our dearest
friend, and let us know that it is ever so false and malicious, yet it
will answer its end; it connects the person’s name and idea with an
ugly association, you think of them with pain together, or it requires
an effort of indignation or magnanimity on your part to disconnect
them; it becomes an uneasy subject, a sore point, and you will sooner
desert your friend, or join in the conspiracy against him, than be constantly
forced to repel charges without truth or meaning, and have
your penetration or character called in question by a rascal. Nay,
such is the unaccountable construction of language and of the human
mind, that the affixing the most innocent or praiseworthy appellation
to any individual or set of individuals, <em>as a nickname</em>, has all the effect
of the most opprobrious epithets. Thus the cant name ‘The Talents,’
was successfully applied as a stigma to the Whigs at one time; it
held them up to ridicule, and made them obnoxious to public feeling,
though it was notorious to every body that the Whig leaders were
‘the Talents,’ and that their adversaries nicknamed them so from
real hatred and pretended derision. ‘The Party’ is now substituted
for ‘the Talents,’ since success has given their own set the monstrous
affectation of being men of talents; and the poor Morning Chronicle
is persecuted daily as the Party as it formerly stood the brunt
(innocently enough) of all the abuse and sarcasms that were
showered on the Talents. Call a man short by his Christian name,
as Tom or Dick such a one, or by his profession, (however
respectable), as Canning pelted a noble lord with his left-off
title of Doctor,—and you undo him for ever, if he has a reputation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>to lose. Such is the tenaciousness of spite and ill-nature, or the
jealousy of public opinion, even this will be peg enough to hang
doubtful inuendos, weighty dilemmas upon. ‘With so small a web
as this will I catch so great a fly as Cassio.’ The public do not like
to see their favourites treated with impertinent familiarity—it lowers
the tone of admiration very speedily. It implies that some one stands
in no great awe of their idol, and he perhaps may know as much
about the matter as they do. It seems as if a man whose name, with
some contemptuous abbreviation, is always dinned in the public ear,
was distinguished by nothing else. By repeating a man’s name in
this manner you may soon make him sick of it, and of his life too.
Mr. Southey has by this time, I should suppose, a tolerable surfeit of
his title of Laureate! Children do not like to be <em>called out of their
names</em>. It is questioning their personal identity. A writer, who has
made his vocabulary rich in nicknames, (the late Editor of the
Times,) thought he had made a great acquisition to his stock, when
it was pretended at one time that Bonaparte’s real name was not
Napoleon but Nicholas. He congratulated himself on this discovery,
as a standing jest and a lasting triumph. Yet there was nothing in
the name to signify. Nicholas Poussin was an instance of a great
man in the last age, and in our own times, have we not Nicholas
Vansittart? The same writer has the merit of having carried this
figure of speech as far as it would go. He fairly worried his readers
into conviction by abuse and nicknames. People surrendered their
judgments to escape the persecution of his style, and the disgust and
indignation which his incessant violence and vulgarity excited, at last
made you hate those who were the objects of it. <i><span lang="la">Causa causæ causa
causati.</span></i> He made people sick of a subject by making them sick
of his arguments. Yet he attributed the effect he produced to the
eloquence of his phraseology and the force of his reasonings!</p>

<p class='c007'>A parrot may be taught to call names; and if the person who keeps
the parrot has a spite to his neighbours, he may give them a great
deal of annoyance without much wit, either in the employer or the
puppet. The insignificance of the instrument has nothing to do with
the efficacy of the means. Hotspur would have had ‘a <em>starling</em> taught
to repeat nothing but Mortimer,’ in the ears of his enemy. Nature,
it is said, has given arms to all creatures the most proper to defend
themselves, and annoy others: to the lowest she has given the use of
nicknames.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some droll instances of the effect of proper names combined
with circumstances. A young student had come up to London
from Cambridge, and went in the evening and planted himself in the
pit of the play-house. He had not been seated long when, in one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>the front boxes near him, he discovered one of his college tutors,
with whom he felt an immediate and strong desire to claim acquaintance,
and called out in a low and respectful voice, ‘Dr. Topping!’
The appeal was, however, ineffectual. He then repeated in a louder
tone, but still in an under key, so as not to excite the attention of any
one but his friend, ‘Dr. Topping!’ The Doctor took no notice.
He then grew more impatient, and repeated ‘Dr. Topping, Dr.
Topping!’ two or three times pretty loud, to see whether the Doctor
did not or would not hear him. Still the Doctor remained immovable.
The joke began at length to get round, and one or two persons,
as he continued his invocations of the Doctor’s name, joined with him
in them; these were reinforced by others calling out, ‘Dr. Topping!
Dr. Topping!’ on all sides, so that he could no longer avoid perceiving
it, and at length the whole pit rose and roared, ‘Dr. Topping!’
with loud and repeated cries, and the Doctor was forced to
retire precipitately, frightened at the sound of his own name. There
is sometimes an inconvenience in common as well as uncommon names.
On the night that Garrick took his leave of the stage, an inveterate
playgoer could not get a seat in any part of the house. At length he
went up into the gallery, but found that equally full with the rest.
In this extremity a thought struck him, and he called out as loud as
he could, ‘Mr. Smith, you’re wanted. Your wife’s taken suddenly
ill, and you must go home immediately.’ In an instant, half a dozen
persons started up from different parts of the gallery to go out, and
the gentleman took possession of the first place that offered. No
doubt these persons would be disposed to quarrel with their names
and their wives for some time after.</p>

<p class='c007'>The calling people by their Christian or surnames is a proof of
affection, as well as of hatred. They are generally the best good
fellows with whom their friends take this sort of liberty. <em>Diminutives</em>
are titles of endearment. Dr. Johnson’s calling Goldsmith ‘Goldy’
did equal honour to both. It shewed the regard he had for him.
This familiarity may perhaps imply a certain want of formal respect;
but formal respect is not necessary to, if it is consistent with, cordial
friendship. Titles of honour are the reverse of nicknames,—they
convey the idea of respect as the others do of contempt, and equally
mean little or nothing. Junius’s motto, <i><span lang="la">Stat nominis umbra</span></i>, is a very
significant one, it might be extended farther. A striking instance of
the force of names, standing by themselves, is in the respect felt
towards Michael Angelo in this country. We know nothing of him
but his name. It is an abstraction of fame and greatness. Our admiration
of him supports itself, and our idea of his superiority seems
self-evident, because it is attached to his name only. Some of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>artists seem trying to puff their names into reputation from an instinctive
knowledge of this principle,—by talking incessantly of themselves
and doing nothing. It is not, indeed, easy to deny the merit of the
works—which they do <em>not</em> produce. Those which they have produced
are very bad.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taste is nothing but sensibility to the different degrees and kinds of
excellence in the works of art or nature. This definition will
perhaps be disputed; for I am aware the general practice is to make
it consist in a disposition to find fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>A French man or woman will in general conclude their account of
Voltaire’s denunciation of Shakespeare and Milton as barbarians, on
the score of certain technical improprieties, with assuring you, that
‘he (Voltaire) had a great deal of taste.’ It is their phrase, <i><span lang="fr">Il avait
beaucoup du goût</span></i>. To which the proper answer is, that that might
be; but that he did not shew it in this case; as the overlooking great
and countless beauties, and being taken up only with petty or accidental
blemishes, shews as little strength of understanding as it does
refinement or elevation of taste. The French author, indeed, allows
of Shakespeare, that ‘he had found a few pearls on his enormous
dunghill.’ But there is neither truth nor proportion in this sentence,
for his works are (to say the least),</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Rich as the oozy bottom of the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Genius is the power of producing excellence: taste is the power
of perceiving the excellence thus produced in its several sorts and
degrees, with all their force, refinement, distinctions, and connections.
In other words, taste (as it relates to the productions of art) is strictly
the power of being properly affected by works of genius. It is the
proportioning admiration to power, pleasure to beauty: it is entire
sympathy with the finest impulses of the imagination, not antipathy,
not indifference to them. The eye of taste may be said to reflect the
impressions of real genius, as the even mirror reflects the objects
of nature in all their clearness and lustre, instead of distorting or
diminishing them;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>To take a pride and pleasure in nothing but defects (and those
perhaps of the most paltry, obvious, and mechanical kind)—in the
disappointment and tarnishing of our faith in substantial excellence, in
the proofs of weakness, not of power, (and this where there are endless
subjects to feed the mind with wonder and increased delight
through years of patient thought and fond remembrance), is not a sign
of uncommon refinement, but of unaccountable perversion of taste.
So, in the case of Voltaire’s hypercriticisms on Milton and Shakespeare,
the most common-place and prejudiced admirer of these authors
knows, as well as Voltaire can tell him, that it is a fault to make a
sea-port (we will say) in Bohemia, or to introduce artillery and gunpowder
in the war in Heaven. This is common to Voltaire, and the
merest English reader: there is nothing in it either way. But what
he differs from us in, and, as it is supposed, greatly to his advantage,
and to our infinite shame and mortification, is, that this is all that he
perceives, or will hear of in Milton or Shakespeare, and that he either
knows, or pretends to know, nothing of that prodigal waste, or studied
accumulation of grandeur, truth, and beauty, which are to be found
in each of these authors. Now, I cannot think, that, to be dull and
insensible to so great and such various excellence,—to have no feeling
in unison with it, no latent suspicion of the treasures hid beneath our
feet, and which we trample upon with ignorant scorn, to be cut off,
as by a judicial blindness, from that universe of thought and imagination
that shifts its wondrous pageant before us, to turn aside from the
throng and splendour of airy shapes that fancy weaves for our dazzled
sight, and to strut and vapour over a little pettifogging blunder in
geography or chronology, which a school-boy, or a village pedagogue,
would be ashamed to insist upon, is any proof of the utmost perfection
of taste, but the contrary. At this rate, it makes no difference
whether Shakespeare wrote his works or not, or whether the critic,
who ‘damns him into everlasting redemption’ for a single slip of the
pen, ever read them;—he is absolved from all knowledge, taste, or
feeling, of the different excellencies, and inimitable creations of the
poet’s pen—from any sympathy with the wanderings and the fate of
Imogen, the beauty and tenderness of Ophelia, the thoughtful abstraction
of Hamlet; his soliloquy on life may never have given him a
moment’s pause, or touched his breast with one solitary reflection;—the
Witches in Macbeth may ‘lay their choppy fingers upon their
skinny lips’ without making any alteration in his pulse,—and Lear’s
heart may break in vain for him;—he may hear no strange noises in
Prospero’s island,—and the moonlight that sleeps on beds of flowers,
where fairies couch in the Midsummer Night’s Dream, may never
once have steeped his senses in repose. Nor will it avail Milton to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>‘have built high towers in Heaven,’ nor to have brought down
heaven upon earth, nor that he has made Satan rear his giant form
before us, ‘majestic though in ruin,’ or decked the bridal bed of Eve
with beauty, or clothed her with innocence, ‘likest heaven,’ as she
ministered to Adam, and his angel guest. Our critic knows nothing
of all this, of beauty or sublimity, of thought or passion, breathed in
sweet or solemn sounds, with all the magic of verse ‘in tones and
numbers hit;’ he lays his finger on the map, and shews you, that
there is no sea-port for Shakespeare’s weather-beaten travellers to land
at in Bohemia, and takes out a list of mechanical inventions, and
proves that gunpowder was not known till long after Milton’s battle
of the angels; and concludes, that every one who, after these profound
and important discoveries, finds anything to admire in these two
writers, is a person without taste, or any pretensions to it. By the
same rule, a thorough-bred critic might prove that Homer was no
poet, and the Odyssey a vulgar performance, because Ulysses makes
a pun on the name of Noman. Or some other disciple of the same
literal school might easily set aside the whole merit of Racine’s
<cite>Athalie</cite>, or Moliere’s <cite>Ecole des Femmes</cite>, and pronounce these <i><span lang="fr">chef d’œuvres</span></i>
of art barbarous and Gothic, because the characters in the
first address one another (absurdly enough) as <em>Monsieur</em> and <em>Madame</em>,
and because the latter is written in rhyme, contrary to all classical
precedent. These little false measures of criticism may be misapplied
and retorted without end, and require to be eked out by national
antipathy or political prejudice to give them currency and weight.
Thus it was in war-time that the author of the ‘Friend’ ventured to
lump all the French tragedies together as a smart collection of
epigrams, and that the author of the ‘Excursion, a poem, being
portion<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c009'><sup>[49]</sup></a> of a larger poem, to be named the Recluse,’ made bold to call
Voltaire a dull prose-writer—with impunity. Such pitiful quackery
is a cheap way of setting up for exclusive taste and wisdom, by pretending
to despise what is most generally admired, as if nothing could
come up to or satisfy that ideal standard of excellence, of which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>person bears about the select pattern in his own mind. ‘Not to
admire any thing’ is as bad a test of wisdom as it is a rule for happiness.
We sometimes meet with individuals who have formed their
whole character on this maxim, and who ridiculously affect a decided
and dogmatical tone of superiority over others, from an uncommon
degree both of natural and artificial stupidity. They are blind to
painting—deaf to music—indifferent to poetry; and they triumph in
the catalogue of their defects as the fault of these arts, because they
have not sense enough to perceive their own want of perception. To
treat any art or science with contempt, is only to prove your own
incapacity and want of taste for it: to say that what has been done
best in any kind is good for nothing, is to say that the utmost
exertion of human ability is not equal to the lowest, for the productions
of the lowest are worth something, except by comparison with
what is better. When we hear persons exclaiming that the pictures
at the Marquis of Stafford’s or Mr. Angerstein’s, or those at the
British Gallery, are a heap of trash, we might tell them that they
betray in this a want not of taste only, but of common sense, for that
these collections contain some of the finest specimens of the greatest
masters, and that <em>that</em> must be excellent in the productions of human
art, beyond which human genius, in any age or country, has not been
able to go. Ask these very fastidious critics what it is that they <em>do</em>
like, and you will soon find, from tracing out the objects of their
secret admiration, that their pretended disdain of first-rate excellence
is owing either to ignorance of the last refinements of works of genius,
or envy at the general admiration which they have called forth. I
have known a furious Phillippic against the faults of shining talents
and established reputation subside into complacent approbation of dull
mediocrity, that neither tasked the kindred sensibility of its admirer
beyond its natural inertness, nor touched his self-love with a consciousness
of inferiority; and that, by never attempting original beauties,
and never failing, gave no opportunity to intellectual ingratitude to be
plausibly revenged for the pleasure or instruction it had reluctantly
received. So there are judges who cannot abide Mr. Kean, and
think Mr. Young an incomparable actor, for no other reason than
because he never shocks them with an idea which they had not
before. The only excuse for the over-delicacy and supercilious
indifference here described, is when it arises from an intimate acquaintance
with, and intense admiration of, other and higher degrees of
perfection and genius. A person whose mind has been worked up to
a lofty pitch of enthusiasm in this way, cannot perhaps condescend to
notice, or be much delighted with inferior beauties; but then neither
will he dwell upon, and be preposterously offended with, slight faults.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>So that the ultimate and only conclusive proof of taste is even here
not indifference, but enthusiasm; and before a critic can give himself
airs of superiority for what he despises, he must first lay himself
open to reprisals, by telling us what he admires. There we may
fairly join issue with him. Without this indispensable condition of
all true taste, absolute stupidity must be more than on a par with
the most exquisite refinement; and the most formidable drawcansir
of all would be the most impenetrable blockhead. Thus, if we know
that Voltaire’s contempt of Shakespeare arose from his idolatry of
Racine, this may excuse him in a national point of view; but he has
no longer any advantage over us; and we must console ourselves as
well as we can for Mr. Wordsworth’s not allowing us to laugh at the
wit of Voltaire, by laughing now and then at the only author whom
he is known to understand and admire!<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c009'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of making a disposition to find fault a proof of taste, I would
reverse the rule, and estimate every one’s pretensions to taste by the
degree of their sensibility to the highest and most various excellence.
An indifference to less degrees of excellence is only excusable as it
arises from a knowledge and admiration of higher ones; and a readiness
in the detection of faults should pass for refinement only as it is
owing to a quick sense and impatient love of beauties. In a word,
fine taste consists in sympathy, not in antipathy; and the rejection of
what is bad is only to be accounted a virtue when it implies a preference
of and attachment to what is better.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a certain point, which may be considered as the highest
point of perfection at which the human faculties can arrive in the
conception and execution of certain things: to be able to reach this
point in reality is the greatest proof of genius and power; and I
imagine that the greatest proof of taste is given in being able to
appreciate it when done. For instance, I have heard (and I can
believe) that Madame Catalani’s manner of singing ‘Hope told a
flattering tale,’ was the perfection of singing; and I cannot conceive
that it would have been the perfection of taste to have thought nothing
at all of it. There was, I understand, a sort of fluttering of the voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>and a breathless palpitation of the heart, (like the ruffling of the
feathers of the robin-redbreast), which completely gave back all the
uneasy and thrilling voluptuousness of the sentiment; and I contend
that the person on whom not a particle of this expression was lost,
(or would have been lost, if it had even been finer), into whom the
tones of sweetness or tenderness sink deeper and deeper as they
approach the farthest verge of ecstacy or agony, he who has an ear
attuned to the trembling harmony, and a heart ‘pierceable’ by
pleasure’s finest point, is the best judge of music,—not he who
remains insensible to the matter himself, or, if you point it out to
him, asks, ‘What of it?’ I fancied that I had a triumph some time
ago, over a critic and connoisseur of music, who thought little of the
minuet in Don Giovanni; but the same person redeemed his pretensions
to musical taste in my opinion by saying of some passage in
Mozart, ‘This is a soliloquy equal to any in Hamlet.’ In hearing
the accompaniment in the Messiah of angels’ voices to the shepherds
keeping watch at night, who has the most taste and delicacy, he who
listens in silent rapture to the silver sounds, as they rise in sweetness
and soften into distance, drawing the soul from earth to heaven, and
making it partaker of the music of the spheres, or he who remains
deaf to the summons, and remarks that it is an allegorical conceit?
Which would Handel have been most pleased with, the man who
was seen standing at the performance of the Coronation anthem in
Westminster Abbey, with his face bathed in tears, and mingling ‘the
drops which sacred joy had engendered’ with that ocean of circling
sound, or with him who sat with frigid, critical aspect, his heart
untouched and his looks unaltered as the marble statue on the wall?<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c009'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
Again, if any one, in looking at Rembrandt’s picture of Jacob’s
Dream, should not be struck with the solemn awe that surrounds it,
and with the dazzling flights of angels’ wings like steps of golden
light, emanations of flame or spirit hovering between earth and sky,
and should observe very wisely that Jacob was thrown in one corner
of the picture like a bundle of clothes, without power, form, or
motion, and should think this a defect, I should say that such a critic
might possess great knowledge of the mechanical part of painting, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>not an atom of feeling or imagination.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Or who is it that, in looking
at the productions of Raphael or Titian, is the person of true taste?
He who finds what there is, or he who finds what there is not in
each? Not he who picks a petty vulgar quarrel with the colouring
of Raphael or the drawing of Titian is the true critic and judicious
spectator, but he who broods over the expression of the one till it
takes possession of his soul, and who dwells on the tones and hues of
the other till his eye is saturated with truth and beauty, for by this
means he moulds his mind to the study and reception of what is most
perfect in form and colour, instead of letting it remain empty, ‘swept
and garnished,’ or rather a dull blank, with ‘knowledge at each
entrance quite shut out.’ He who cavils at the want of drawing in
Titian is not the most sensible to it in Raphael; instead of that, he
only insists on his want of colouring. He who is offended at Raphael’s
hardness and monotony is not delighted with the soft, rich pencilling
of Titian; he only takes care to find fault with him for wanting that
which, if he possessed it in the highest degree, he would not admire
or understand. And this is easy to be accounted for. First, such a
critic has been told what to do, and follows his instructions. Secondly,
to perceive the height of any excellence, it is necessary to have the
most exquisite sense of that kind of excellence through all its gradations:
to perceive the want of any excellence, it is merely necessary
to have a negative or abstract notion of the thing, or perhaps only of
the name. Or, in other words, any the most crude and mechanical
idea of a given quality is a measure of positive deficiency, whereas
none but the most refined idea of the same quality can be a standard
of superlative merit. To distinguish the finest characteristics of
Titian or Raphael, to go along with them in their imitation of
Nature, is to be so far like them: to be occupied only with that in
which they fell short of others, instead of that in which they soared
above them, shows a vulgar, narrow capacity, insensible to any thing
beyond mediocrity, and an ambition still more grovelling. To be
dazzled by admiration of the greatest excellence, and of the highest
works of genius, is natural to the best capacities, and the best natures;
envy and dulness are most apt to detect minute blemishes and unavoidable
inequalities, as we see the spots in the sun by having its rays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>blunted by mist or smoke. It may be asked, then, whether mere
extravagance and enthusiasm are proofs of taste? And I answer, no,
where they are without reason and knowledge. Mere sensibility is
not true taste, but sensibility to real excellence is. To admire and
be wrapt up in what is trifling or absurd, is a proof of nothing but
ignorance or affectation: on the contrary, he who admires most what
is most worthy of admiration, (let his raptures or his eagerness to
express them be what they may), shows himself neither extravagant
nor ‘unwise.’ When Mr. Wordsworth once said that he could read
the description of Satan in Milton,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>‘Nor seem’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Less than archangel ruin’d, and the excess</div>
      <div class='line'>Of glory obscur’d,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>till he felt a certain faintness come over his mind from a sense of
beauty and grandeur, I saw no extravagance in this, but the utmost
truth of feeling. When the same author, or his friend Mr. Southey,
says, that the Excursion is better worth preserving than the Paradise
Lost, this appears to me, I confess, a great piece of impertinence, or an
unwarrantable stretch of friendship. Nor do I think the preference
given by certain celebrated reviewers, of Mr. Rogers’s Human Life
over Mr. Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads, founded on the true principles
of poetical justice; for something is, after all, better than nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>To hasten to a conclusion of these desultory observations. The
highest taste is shown in habitual sensibility to the greatest beauties;
the most general taste is shown in a perception of the greatest variety
of excellence. Many people admire Milton, and as many admire
Pope, while there are but few who have any relish for both. Almost
all the disputes on this subject arise, not so much from false, as from
confined taste. We suppose that only one thing can have merit;
and that, if we allow it to any thing else, we deprive the favourite
object of our critical faith of the honours due to it. We are generally
right in what we approve ourselves; for liking proceeds from a certain
conformity of objects to the taste; as we are generally wrong in condemning
what others admire; for our dislike mostly proceeds from our
want of taste for what pleases them. Our being totally senseless to
what excites extreme delight in those who have as good a right to
judge as we have, in all human probability implies a defect of faculty
in us, rather than a limitation in the resources of nature or art. Those
who are pleased with the fewest things, know the least; as those who
are pleased with every thing, know nothing. Shakespeare makes
Mrs. Quickly say of Falstaff, by a pleasant blunder, that ‘Carnation
was a colour he could never abide.’ So there are persons who cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>like Claude, because he is not Salvator Rosa; some who cannot
endure Rembrandt, and others who would not cross the street to see
a Vandyke; one reader does not like the neatness of Junius, and
another objects to the extravagance of Burke; and they are all right,
if they expect to find in others what is only to be found in their
favourite author or artist, but equally wrong if they mean to say, that
each of those they would condemn by a narrow and arbitrary standard
of taste, has not a peculiar and transcendent merit of his own. The
question is not, whether <em>you</em> like a certain excellence, (it is your own
fault if you do not), but whether another possessed it in a very
eminent degree. If he did not, who is there that possessed it in a
greater—that ranks above him in that particular? Those who are
accounted the best, are the best in their line. When we say that
Rembrandt was a master of <em>chiaro-scuro</em>, for instance, we do not say
that he joined to this the symmetry of the Greek statues, but we
mean that we must go to him for the perfection of <em>chiaro-scuro</em>, and
that a Greek statue has not <em>chiaro-scuro</em>. If any one objects to
Junius’s Letters, that they are a tissue of epigrams, we answer, Be it
so; it is for that very reason that we admire them. Again, should
any one find fault with Mr. Burke’s writings as a collection of
rhapsodies, the proper answer always would be, Who is there that
has written finer rhapsodies? I know an admirer of Don Quixote
who can see no merit in Gil Blas, and an admirer of Gil Blas who
could never get through Don Quixote. I myself have great pleasure
in reading both these works, and in that respect think I have an
advantage over both these critics. It always struck me as a singular
proof of good taste, good sense, and liberal thinking, in an old friend,
who had Paine’s Rights of Man and Burke’s Reflections on the
French Revolution, bound up in one volume, and who said, that,
both together, they made a very good book. To agree with the
greatest number of good judges, is to be in the right; and good
judges are persons of natural sensibility and acquired knowledge.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c009'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
On the other hand, it must be owned, there are critics whose praise
is a libel, and whose recommendation of any work is enough to
condemn it. Men of the greatest genius and originality are not
always persons of the most liberal and unprejudiced taste; they have
a strong bias to certain qualities themselves, are for reducing others
to their own standard, and lie less open to the general impressions of
things. This exclusive preference of their own peculiar excellencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>to those of others, in writers whose merits have not been sufficiently
understood or acknowledged by their contemporaries, chiefly because
they were <em>not</em> common-place, may sometimes be seen mounting up to
a degree of bigotry and intolerance, little short of insanity. There
are some critics I have known who never allow an author any merit
till all the world ‘cry out upon him,’ and others who never allow
another any merit that any one can discover but themselves. So
there are connoisseurs who spend their lives and waste their breath in
extolling sublime passages in obscure writers, and lovers who choose
their mistresses for their ugly faces. This is not taste, but affectation.
What is popular is not necessarily vulgar; and that which
we try to rescue from fatal obscurity, had in general much better
remain in it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Taste relates to that which, either in the objects of nature, or
the imitation of them or the Fine Arts in general is calculated
to give pleasure. Now, to know what is calculated to give pleasure,
the way is to enquire what does give pleasure: so that taste is, after
all, much more a matter of fact and less of theory than might be
imagined. We may hence determine another point, <em>viz.</em>—whether
there is any universal or exclusive standard of taste, since this is to
inquire, in other words, whether there is any one thing that pleases
all the world alike, or whether there is only one thing that pleases
anybody, both which questions carry their own answers with them.
Still it does not follow, because there is no dogmatic or bigoted
standard of taste, like a formula of faith, which whoever does not
believe without doubt he shall be damned everlastingly, that there is
no standard of taste whatever, that is to say, that certain things are
not more apt to please than others, that some do not please more
generally, that there are not others that give most pleasure to those
who have studied the subject, that one nation is most susceptible of
a particular kind of beauty, and another of another, according to their
characters, &#38;c. It would be a difficult attempt to force all these
into one general rule or system, and yet equally so to deny that they
are absolutely capricious, and without any foundation or principle
whatever. There are, doubtless, books for children that we discard
as we grow up; yet, what are the majority of mankind, or even
readers, but grown children? If put to the vote of all the milliners’
girls in London, <cite>Old Mortality</cite>, or even <cite>Heart of Midlothian</cite>, would
not carry the day (or, at least, not very triumphantly) over a common
Minerva-press novel; and I will hazard another opinion, that no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>woman ever liked Burke. Mr. Pratt, on the contrary, said that he
had to ‘boast of many learned and beautiful suffrages.’<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c009'><sup>[54]</sup></a> It is not,
then, solely from the greatest number of voices, but from the opinion
of the greatest number of well-informed minds, that we can establish,
if not an absolute standard, at least a comparative scale, of taste.
Certainly, it can hardly be doubted that the greater the number of
persons of strong natural sensibility or love for any art, and who have
paid the closest attention to it, who agree in their admiration of any
work of art, the higher do its pretensions rise to classical taste and
intrinsic beauty. In this way, as the opinion of a thousand good
judges may outweigh that of nearly all the rest of the world, so there
may be one individual among them whose opinion may outweigh that
of the other nine hundred and ninety-nine; that is, one of a still
stronger and more refined perception of beauty than all the rest, and
to whose opinion that of the others and of the world at large would
approximate and be conformed, as their taste or perception of what
was pleasing became stronger and more confirmed by exercise and
proper objects to call it forth. Thus, if we were still to insist on an
universal standard of taste, it must be that, not which <em>does</em>, but which
<em>would</em> please universally, supposing all men to have paid an equal
attention to any subject and to have an equal relish for it, which can
only be guessed at by the imperfect and yet more than casual agreement
among those who have done so from choice and feeling. Taste
is nothing but an enlarged capacity for receiving pleasure from works
of imagination, &#38;c. It is time, however, to apply this rule. There
is, for instance, a much greater number of habitual readers and playgoers
in France, who are devoted admirers of Racine or Molière
than there are in England of Shakspeare: does Shakspeare’s fame
rest, then, on a less broad and solid foundation than that of either of
the others? I think not, supposing that the class of judges to whom
Shakspeare’s excellences appeal are a higher, more independent, and
more original court of criticism, and that their suffrages are quite as
unanimous (though not so numerous) in the one case as in the other.
A simile or a sentiment is not the worse in common opinion for
being somewhat superficial and hackneyed, but it is the worse in
poetry. The perfection of <em>common-place</em> is that which would unite
the greatest number of suffrages, if there were not a tribunal above
<em>common-place</em>. For instance, in Shakspeare’s description of flowers,
primroses are mentioned—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘That come before the swallow dares, and take</div>
      <div class='line'>The winds of March with beauty:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>Now, I do not know that this expression is translatable into French,
or intelligible to the common reader of either nation, but raise the
scale of fancy, passion, and observation of nature to a certain point,
and I will be bold to say that there will be no scruple entertained
whether this single metaphor does not contain more poetry of the
kind than is to be found in all Racine. As no Frenchman could
write it, so I believe no Frenchman could understand it. We cannot
take this insensibility on their part as a mark of our superiority,
for we have plenty of persons among ourselves in the same predicament,
but not the wisest or most refined, and to these the appeal is
fair from the many—‘and fit audience find, though few.’ So I
think it requires a higher degree of taste to judge of Titian’s portraits
than Raphael’s scripture pieces: not that I think more highly of the
former than the latter, but the world and connoisseurs in general
think there is no comparison (from the dignity of the subject),
whereas I think it difficult to decide which are the finest. Here
again we have a common-place, a preconception, the moulds of the
judgment preoccupied by certain assumptions of degrees and classes
of excellence, instead of judging from the true and genuine impressions
of things. Men of genius, or those who can produce excellence
would be the best judges of it—poets of poetry, painters of painting,
&#38;c.—but that persons of original and strong powers of mind are too
much disposed to refer everything to their own peculiar bias, and are
comparatively indifferent to merely passive impressions. On the other
hand, it is wholly wrong to oppose taste to genius, for genius in works
of art is nothing but the power of producing what is beautiful (which,
however, implies the intimate sense of it), though this is something
very different from mere negative or formal beauties, which have as
little to do with taste as genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have, in a former essay, ascertained one principle of taste or
excellence in the arts of imitation, where it was shown that objects
of sense are not as it were simple and self-evident propositions, but
admit of endless analysis and the most subtle investigation. We do
not see nature with our eyes, but with our understandings and our
hearts. To suppose that we see the whole of any object, merely by
looking at it, is a vulgar error: we fancy that we do, because we
are, of course, conscious of no more than we see in it, but this circle
of our knowledge enlarges with further acquaintance and study, and
we then perceive that what we perhaps barely distinguished in the
gross, or regarded as a dull blank, is full of beauty, meaning, and
curious details. He sees most of nature who understands its language
best, or connects one thing with the greatest number of other things.
Expression is the key to the human countenance, and unfolds a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>thousand imperceptible distinctions. How, then, should every one
be a judge of pictures, when so few are of faces? A merely ignorant
spectator, walking through a gallery of pictures, no more distinguishes
the finest than your dog would, if he was to accompany you. Do
not even the most experienced dispute on the preference, and shall
the most ignorant decide? A vulgar connoisseur would even prefer
a Denner to a Titian, because there is more of merely curious and
specific detail. We may hence account for another circumstance,
why things please in the imitation which do not in reality. If we
saw the whole of anything, or if the object in nature were merely
one thing, this could not be the case. But the fact is, that in the
imitation, or in the scientific study of any object, we come to an
analysis of the details or some other abstract view of the subject
which we had overlooked in a cursory examination, and these may
be beautiful or curious, though the object in the gross is disgusting,
or connected with disagreeable or uninteresting associations. Thus,
in a picture of <em>still life</em>, as a shell or a marble chimney-piece, the stains
or the gradations of colour may be delicate, and subjects for a new
and careful imitation, though the <i><span lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> has not, like a living
face, the highest beauty of intelligence and expression. Here lie
and here return the true effects and triumphs of art. It is not in
making the eye a microscope, but in making it the interpreter and
organ of all that can touch the soul and the affections, that the
perfection of fine art is shown. Taste, then, does not place in the
first rank of merit what merely proves difficulty or gratifies curiosity,
unless it is combined with excellence and sentiment, or the pleasures of
imagination and the moral sense. In this case the pleasure is more
than doubled, where not only the imitation but the thing imitated, is fine
in itself. Hence the preference given to Italian over Dutch pictures.</p>

<p class='c007'>In respect to the imitation of nature, I would further observe that
I think Sir Joshua Reynolds was wrong in making the grandeur of
the design depend on the omission of the details, or the want of
finishing. This seems also to proceed on the supposition that there
cannot be two views of nature, but that the details are opposed to and
inconsistent with an attention to general effect. Now this is evidently
false, since the two things are undoubtedly combined by nature. For
instance, the grandeur of design or character in the arch of an eyebrow
is not injured or destroyed in reality by the hair-lines of which
it is composed. Nor is the general form or outline of the eyebrow
altered in the imitation, whether you make it one rude mass or
descend into the minutiæ of the parts, which are arranged in such a
manner as to produce the arched form and give the particular expression.
So the general form of a nose, say an aquiline one, is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>affected, whether I paint a wart which may happen to be on it or
not, and so of the outline and proportions of the whole face. That
is, general effect is consistent with individual details, and though these
are not necessary to it, yet they often assist it, and always confirm
the sense of verisimilitude. The most finished paintings, it is true,
are not the grandest in effect; but neither is it true that the greatest
daubs are the most sublime in character and composition. The best
painters have combined an eye to the whole with careful finishing,
and as there is a medium in all things, so the rule here seems to be
not to go on <i><span lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i> with the details, but to stop when the time
and labour necessary seem, in the judgment of the artist, to exceed
the benefit produced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beauty does not consist in a medium, but in gradation or harmony.
It has been the fashion of late to pretend to refer everything to
association of ideas (and it is difficult to answer this appeal, since
association, by its nature, mixes up with everything), but as Hartley
has himself observed, who carried this principle to the utmost extent,
and might be supposed to understand its limits, association implies
something to be associated, and if there is a pleasing association, there
must be first something naturally pleasing from which the secondary
satisfaction is reflected, or to which it is conjoined. The chirping of
a sparrow is as much a rural and domestic sound as the notes of the
robin or the thrush, but it does not serve as a point to link other
interests to because it wants beauty in itself; and, on the other hand,
the song of the nightingale draws more attention to itself as a piece of
music, and conveys less sentiment than the simple note of the cuckoo,
which, from its solitary singularity, acts as the warning voice of time.
Those who deny that there is a natural and pleasing softness arising
from harmony or gradation, might as well affirm that sudden and
abrupt transitions do not make our impressions more distinct as that
they do not make them more harsh and violent. Beauty consists in
gradation of colours or symmetry of form (conformity): strength or
sublimity arises from the sense of power, and is aided by contrast.
The ludicrous is the incoherent, arising, not from a conflicting power,
but from weakness or the inability of any habitual impulse to sustain
itself. The <em>ideal</em> is not confined to creation, but takes place in
imitation, where a thing is subjected to one view, as all the parts of a
face to the same expression. Invention is only feigning according to
nature, or with a certain proportion between causes and effects. Poetry
is infusing the same spirit into a number of things, or bathing them
all as it were, in the same overflowing sense of delight (making the
language also soft and musical), as the same torch kindles a number
of lamps. I think invention is chiefly confined to poetry and words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>or ideas, and has little place in painting or concrete imagery, where
the want of truth, or of the actual object, soon spoils the effect and
force of the representation. Indeed, I think all genius is, in a great
measure, national and local, arising out of times and circumstances,
and being sustained at its full height by these alone, and that originality
is not a deviation from, but a recurrence to nature. Rules and
models destroy genius and art; and the excess of the artificial in the
end cures itself, for it in time becomes so uniform and vapid as to be
altogether contemptible, and to seek <em>perforce</em> some other outlet or
purchase for the mind to take hold of.</p>

<p class='c007'>The metaphysical theory above premised will account not only for
the difficulty of imitating nature, but for the excellence of various
masters, and the diversity and popularity of different styles. If the
truth of sense and nature were one, there could be but one mode of
representing it, more or less correct. But nature contains an infinite
variety of parts, with their relations and significations, and different
artists take these, and altogether do not give the whole. Thus Titian
coloured, Raphael designed, Rubens gave the florid hue and motions,
Rembrandt <em>chiaro-scuro</em>, &#38;c.; but none of these reached perfection in
their several departments, much less with reference to the whole
circumference of art. It is ridiculous to suppose there is but one
standard or one style. One artist looks at objects with as different
an eye from another, as he does from the mathematician. It is
erroneous to tie down individual genius to ideal models. Each
person should do that, not which is best in itself, even supposing this
could be known, but that which he can do best, which he will find
out if left to himself. Spenser could not have written <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,
nor Milton the <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>. Those who aim at faultless regularity
will only produce mediocrity, and no one ever approaches perfection
except by stealth, and unknown to themselves. Did Correggio know
what he had done when he had painted the ‘St. Jerome’—or
Rembrandt when he made the sketch of ‘Jacob’s Dream?’ Oh,
no! Those who are conscious of their powers never do anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a fine impertinence of the younger Pliny, to try to persuade
Tacitus, in one of his epistles, that the diffuse style was better than
the concise. ‘Such a one,’ says he, ‘aims at the throat of his

<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>thought guilty of a like piece of officiousness in the remarks here

In general, to suggest advice, or hazard criticism, is to recommend it to
others to do something, which we know they either will not or cannot

present article may be considered as a marginal note or explanatory

<p class='c007'>The haughty tone of invective which I have already ascribed to
Lord Chatham, was very different from that didactic style of parliamentary
oratory which has since been imported from northern
colleges and lecture-rooms. Of this school Sir James Mackintosh
and Mr. Brougham may be reckoned at the head.</p>

<p class='c007'>This method consists, not so much in taking a side, as in stating a
question. The speaker takes upon him to be the judge rather than
the advocate; and if he had the authority of a judge, or could direct
the decision, as well as sum up the evidence, it would be all very
well. An orator of this stamp does not seat himself on the Opposition
side of the House to urge or to reply to particular points, but in
a Professor’s chair of Humanity, to read a lecture to the tyros of the
Treasury-Bench, on the elementary principles and all the possible
bearings, the objections and answers, the difficulties and the solutions
of every question in philosophy, jurisprudence, politics, and political
economy,—on war, peace, ‘domestic treason, foreign levy,’ colonial
produce, copy-right of authors, prison discipline, the hulks, the
corn-bill, the penitentiary, prostitutes, and pick-pockets. Nothing
comes amiss to him that can puzzle himself or <em>pose</em> his hearers; and
he lets out all his knowledge indiscriminately, whether it makes for
or against him, with deliberate impartiality and scrupulous exactness.
Such persons might be called <cite>Orators of the Human Mind</cite>. They are
a little out of their place, it must be owned, in the House of
Commons. The object there is—not to put the majority in possession
of the common grounds of judging, as in a class of students—(these
are taken for granted as already known)—but to carry a
point, to gain a verdict for yourself or for truth, by throwing the
weight of eloquence and argument into the scale against interest,
prejudice, or sophistry. There are retainers enough on the other side
to manage for the crown, who are ready to take all advantages without
your volunteering to place yourself in their power, or to put
excuses in their mouths, to help them out at a dead-lift. If they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>were candid, if they were disinterested, if they were not hostilely
disposed, it might be a feasible scheme to consider a debate as an
amicable communication of doubts and lights, as a comparison of
strength or a confession of weakness: but why hint a doubt, or start
a difficulty needlessly in your own path, which will be eagerly caught
at, and made use of in the most insulting manner to defeat a host of
real proofs, and overturn the most legitimate conclusions? Why
tamper with your own cause? Why play at fast and loose with your
object? Why restore the weapons into your enemies’ hands, which
you have just wrested from them? Why ‘make a wanton’ of the
First Minister of State? It is either vanity, weakness, or indifference
to do so. You might as well in confidence tell an adversary
where you meant to strike him, point out to him your own weak
sides, or wait in courtesy for the blow. Gamesters do not show one
another their hands: neither should politicians, who understand what
they are about—that is, knaves <em>will</em> not, and honest men <em>ought</em> not.
Others will find out the rotten parts of a question: do you stick to
the sound—knowledge is said to be power: but knowledge, applied
as we have seen it, neutralises itself. Mere knowledge, to be effectual,
must act <i><span lang="la">in vacuo</span></i>: but the House of Commons is by no means a
vacuum, and empty receiver for abstract truth and airy speculation.
There is the resistance, the refrangibility of dense prejudice and
crooked policy: you must concentrate, you must enforce, you must
urge to glowing sympathy: and enthusiasm, zeal, perfect conviction
on your part, is the only principle that can be brought into play against
the cool calculations or gross incentives of selfishness and servility on
the opposite side. A middle line of conduct does not excite respect,
but contempt. They do not think you sincere, but lukewarm.
They give you credit for affectation or timidity, but none for heartiness
in a cause, or fidelity to a party. They have more hopes of you
than fears. By everlasting subtle distinctions, and hesitating, qualified,
retracting dissent from measures you would be thought most to
reprobate, you do more harm than good. In theory there are infinite
shades of difference, but in practice the question must be decided one
way or other: either the Ayes or the Noes must have it. In all such
cases, those who are not for us are against us. In political controversy,
as in a battle, there are but two sides to chuse between; and
those who create a diversion in favour of established abuses by setting
up a third, fanciful, impracticable standard of perfection of their own,
in the most critical circumstances, betray the cause they pretend to
espouse with such overweening delicacy. For my own part, I hate a
fellow who picks a hole in his own coat, who finds a flaw in his own
argument, who treats his enemies as if they might become friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>or his friends as if they might become enemies. I hate your shuffling,
<em>shilly-shally</em> proceedings, and diagonal sidelong movements between
right and wrong. Fling yourself into the gap at once—either into
the arms, or at the heads of Ministers!</p>

<p class='c007'>I remember hearing, with some pain and uneasiness, Sir James
Mackintosh’s maiden speech on the Genoa business. It was a great,
but ineffectual effort. The mass of information, of ingenuity, and
reasoning, was very prodigious; but the whole was misdirected, no
impression whatever was made. It was like an inaugural dissertation
on the general principles of ethics, on the laws of nature and nations,
on ancient and modern history—a laboured treatise <i><span lang="la">de omnibus rebus et
quibusdam aliis</span></i>. There were all the rules of moral arithmetic, all
the items in a profligate political account; but the bill was not
properly cast up, the case was not distinctly made out, the counsel
got no damages for his client. Nothing was gained by this motion,
nor could there be. When he had brought his heaviest artillery to
bear with probable success upon a certain point, he stopped short like
a scientific demonstrator (not like a skilful engineer) to show how it
might be turned against himself. When he had wound up the charge
of treachery or oppression to a climax, he gratuitously suggested a
possible plea of necessity, accident, or some other topic, to break the
force of his inference; or he anticipated the answers that might be
made to it, as if he was afraid he should not be thought to know all
that could be said on both sides of the question. This enlarged
knowledge of good and evil may be very necessary to a philosopher,
but it is very prejudicial to an orator. No man can play the whole
game in this manner, blow hot and cold in a breath, or take an entire
debate into his own hands, and wield it in which way he pleases.
He will find his own load enough for his own shoulders to bear.
The exceptions if you chuse to go into them, multiply faster than the
rules: the various complications of the subject distract, instead of
convincing: you do your adversary’s work for him; the battle is lost
without a blow being struck; and a speech of this sceptical kind
requires and receives no answer. It falls by its own weight, and
buries any body but the Minister under its ruins—or it is left, not a
triumphal arch, but a splendid mausoleum of the learning, genius, and
eloquence of the speaker.—The Cock-pit of St. Stephen’s does not
relish this scholastic refinement, this method of holding an argument
with a man’s self: a little bear-garden, cut-and-thrust work would be
much better understood. Sir James has of late improved his tact and
knowledge of the House. He has taken up Sir Samuel Romilly’s
department of questions relating to the amelioration of the penal code
and general humanity, and I have no doubt Government will leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>him in quiet possession of it. They concede these sort of questions
as an amiable diversion, or friendly <em>bonus</em>, to the indefatigable spirit of
Opposition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Brougham is, I conceive, another instance of this analytical
style of debating, which ‘plays round the head, but does not reach
the heart.’ There is a want of warmth, of <em>momentum</em>, of impulse in
his speeches. He loses himself in an infinity of details, as his learned
and honourable friend does in a wide sea of speculation. He goes
picking up a number of curious pebbles on the shore, and at the outlets
of a question—but he does not ‘roll all his strength and all his
sharpness up into one ball,’ to throw at and crush his enemies beneath
his feet. He enters into statistics, he calls for documents, he examines
accounts. This method is slow, perplexing, circuitous, and
not sure. While the evidence is collecting, the question is lost.
While one thing is substantiating, another goes out of your mind.
These little detached multifarious particulars, which require such
industry and sagacity in the speaker to bring them forward, have no
clue in the minds of the hearers to connect them together. There is
no substratum of prejudice, no cement of interest. They do not grow
out of the soil of common feeling and experience, but are set in it;
nor do they bear the fruits of conviction. Mr. Brougham can follow
the ramifications of an intricate subject, but he is not so well acquainted
with the springs of the human mind. He finds himself at
the end of his speech,—in the last sentence of it,—just where he was
at the beginning, or in any other given part of it. He has not acquired
any additional <em>impetus</em>, is not projected forward with any new
degree of warmth or vigour. He was cold, correct, smart, pointed
at first, and he continues so still. A repetition of blows, however,
is of no use, unless they are struck in the same place: a change of
position is not progression. As Sir James Mackintosh’s speeches are
a decomposition of the moral principles of society, so Mr. Brougham’s
are an ingenious taking in pieces of its physical mechanism. While
they are at work with their experiments, their antagonists are putting
in motion the passions, the fears, and antipathies of mankind, and
blowing their schemes of reform above the moon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Talent alone, then, is not sufficient to support a successful Opposition.
There is talent on the other side too, of some sort or other;
and, in addition, there is another weight, that of influence, which
requires a counterpoise. This can be nothing else but fixed principle,
but naked honesty, but undisguised enthusiasm. That is the expansive
force that must shatter the strongholds of corruption if ever they
are shattered, that must make them totter, if ever they are made to
totter, about the heads of their possessors. Desire to expose a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>ministry, and you will do it—if it be, like ours, vulnerable all over.
Desire to make a display of yourself, and you will do it, if you have
a decent stock of acquirements. Mr. Brougham has a great quantity
of combustible materials constantly passing through his hands, but he
has not the warmth in his own heart to ‘kindle them into a flame of
sacred vehemence.’ He is not a good hater. He is not an impassioned
lover of the popular cause. He is not a Radical orator: he
is not a Back-bone debater. He wants nerve, he wants impetuosity.
He may divide on a question, but he will never carry it. His circumspection,
which he thinks his strength, is in reality his weakness.
He makes paltry excuses, unmanly concessions. His political warfare
is not a <i><span lang="la">bellum internecinum</span></i>. He commits no mortal offences. He
has not yet cut off his retreat. In a word, he trims too much between
all parties. A person who does this too long, loses the confidence,
loses the cordiality of all parties; loses his character; and when he
has once lost that, there is nothing to stand in his way to office and
the first honours of the State!</p>

<p class='c007'>He who is not indifferent himself will find out, from his own
feelings, what it is that interests others in a cause. An honest man
is an orator by nature. The late Mr. Whitbread was an honest man,
and a true parliamentary speaker. He had no artifices, no tricks, no
reserve about him. He spoke point-blank what he thought, and his
heart was in his broad, honest, English face. He had as much activity
of mind as Mr. Brougham, and paid the same attention to business as
that gentleman does; but it was with him a matter of feeling, and
had nothing of a professional look. His objects were open and
direct; and he had a sufficient stock of natural good sense and practical
information, not to be made the dupe of sophistry and chicane.
He was always in his place, and ready to do his duty. If a falsehood
was stated, he contradicted it instantly in a few plain words:
if an act of injustice was palliated, it excited his contempt; if it was
justified, it roused his indignation: he retorted a mean insinuation
with manly spirit, and never shrunk from a frank avowal of his sentiments.
He presented a petition or complaint against some particular
grievance better than any one else I ever saw. His manner seemed
neither to implicate him in the truth of the charge, nor to signify a
wish to disclaim it beforehand. He was merely the organ through
which any alleged abuse of power might meet the public ear, and he
either answered or redressed, according to the merits of the case upon
inquiry. In short, he was the representative of the spontaneous, unsophisticated
sense of the English people on public men and public
measures. Any plain, well-meaning man, on hearing him speak,
would say, ‘That is just what I think’; or from observing his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>manner, would say, ‘That is just what I feel.’ He was not otherwise
a powerful debater or an accomplished speaker. He could not
master a general view of any subject, or get up a set speech with
effect. One or two that I heard him make (particularly one on the
Princess of Wales and the situation of her affairs in 1813, in which
he grew pathetic) were complete failures. He could pull down better
than he could build up. The irritation of constant contradiction was
necessary to his full possession of himself:—give him ‘ample scope
and verge enough,’ and he lost his way. He stuck close to the skirts
of Ministry, but he was not qualified to originate or bring to a
triumphant conclusion any great political movement. His enthusiasm
ran away with his judgment, and was not <em>backed</em> by equal powers of
reasoning or imagination. He was a sanguine, high-spirited man, but
not a man of genius, or a deep thinker; and his fortitude failed him,
when the last fatal blow was given to himself and his party. He
could not have drawn up so able a political statement as Mr. Brougham;
but he would have more personal adherents in the House of Commons,
for he was himself the adherent of a cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tierney is certainly a better speaker and a cleverer man.
But he can never make a leader for want of earnestness. He has
no Quixotic enthusiasm in himself; much less any to spare for his
followers. He cares nothing (or seems to care nothing) about a
question; but he is impatient of absurdity, and has a thorough contempt
for the understandings of his opponents. Sharpened by his
spleen, nothing escapes his acuteness. He makes fine sport for the
spectators. He takes up Lord Castlereagh’s blunders, and Mr.
Vansittart’s no-meanings; and retorts them on their heads in the finest
style of execution imaginable. It is like being present on a Shrove-Tuesday,
and seeing a set of mischievous unfeeling boys throwing at
a brace of cocks, and breaking their shins. Mr. Tierney always
brings down his man: but beyond this you feel no confidence in him;
you take no interest in his movements but as he is instrumental in
annoying other people. He (to all appearance) has no great point
to carry himself, and no wish to be thought to have any important
principle at stake. He is by much too sincere for a hypocrite, but
is not enough in earnest for a parliamentary leader. For others to
sympathise with you, you must first sympathise with them. When
Mr. Whitbread got up to speak, you felt an interest in what he was
going to say, in the success of his arguments: when you hear that
Mr. Tierney is on his legs, you feel that you shall be amused with an
admirable display of dexterity and talent, but are nearly indifferent as
to the result. You look on as at an exhibition of extraordinary skill
in fencing or prize-fighting.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>Of all those who have for some years past aspired by turns to be
leaders of the Opposition, Mr. Ponsonby was the person who had the
fewest pretensions. He was a literal arguer. He affected great
sagacity and judgment, and referred every thing, in a summary way,
to the principles of common sense, and the reason of the case. He
abounded in truisms, which seldom go far in deciding disputable
points. He generally reduced the whole range of the debate into the
narrow compass of a self-evident proposition:—to make sure of his
object, he began by taking the question for granted, and necessarily
failed when he came to the particular application. He was not aware
of the maxim, that he who proves too much, proves nothing. His
turn of observation was legal, not acute: his manner was dry, but
his blows were not hard: his features were flat on his face, and his
arguments did not stand out from the question. He might have been
a tolerable special-pleader, but he was a bad orator, and, I think, a
worse politician. Any one who argues on strict logical grounds must
be prepared to go all lengths, or he will be sure to be defeated at
every step he takes: but the gentleman’s principles were of a very
cautious and temporising cast. I have seen him, more than once, give
himself great airs over those who took more general views of the
subject; and he was very fastidious in the choice of associates, with
whom he would condescend to act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Ponsonby’s style of speaking was neither instructive nor entertaining.
In this respect, it was the reverse of Mr. Grattan’s, which
was both. To see the latter make one of his promised motions on
Catholic Emancipation, was one of the most extraordinary exhibitions,
both bodily and mental, which could possibly be witnessed. You saw
a little oddly-compacted figure of a man, with a large head and features,—such
as they give to pasteboard masks, or stick upon the shoulders
of Punch in the puppet-show,—rolling about like a Mandarin—sawing
the air with his whole body from head to foot, sweeping the floor
with a roll of parchment, which he held in one hand, and throwing
his legs and arms about like the branches of trees tossed by the wind:—every
now and then striking the table with impatient vehemence,
and, in a sharp, slow, nasal, gutteral tone, drawling out, with due
emphasis and discretion, a set of little smart antithetical sentences,—all
ready-cut and dry, polished and pointed;—that seemed as if they
‘would lengthen out in succession to the crack of doom.’ Alliterations
were tacked to alliterations,—inference was dove-tailed into
inference,—and the whole derived new brilliance and piquancy from
the contrast it presented to the uncouthness of the speaker, and the
monotony of his delivery. His were compositions that would have
done equally well to be said or sung. The rhyme was placed at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>beginning instead of the end of each line; he sharpened the sense on
the sound, and clenched an argument by corresponding letters of the
alphabet. It must be confessed, that there was something meretricious,
as well as alluring, in this style. After the first surprise and startling
effect is over, and the devoted champion of his country’s cause goes
on ringing the changes on ‘the Irish People and the Irish Parliament’—on
‘the Guinea and the Gallows,’ as the ultimate resources of
the English government,—on ‘ministerial mismanagement, and privileged
profligacy,’—we begin to feel that there is nothing in these
quaint and affected verbal coincidences more nearly allied to truth
than falsehood:—there is a want of directness and simplicity in this
warped and garbled style; and our attention is drawn off from the
importance of the subject by a shower of epigrammatic conceits, and
fanciful phraseology, in which the orator chuses to veil it. It is
hardly enough to say, in defence of this jingle of words, (as well as
of the overstrained hyperbolical tone of declamation which accompanies
it) that ‘it is a custom of Ireland.’<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c009'><sup>[55]</sup></a> The same objection may
be made to it in point of taste that has been made to the old-fashioned,
obsolete practice of cutting trees into the shape of arm-chairs and peacocks,
or to that style of landscape-gardening, where</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Grove nods to grove, each alley has a brother,</div>
      <div class='line'>And half the platform just reflects the other—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and I am afraid that this objection cannot be got over, at least, on
this side the water.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c009'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The best Irish speaker I ever heard (indeed the best speaker without
any exception whatever) is Mr. Plunkett; who followed Mr. Grattan
in one of the debates on the Catholic question above alluded to.
The contrast was not a little striking; and it was certainly in favour
of Mr. Plunkett. His style of workmanship was more manly and
more masterly. There were no little Gothic ornaments or fantastic
excrescences to catch and break the attention: no quaintness, witticism,
or conceit. Roubilliac, after being abroad, said, that ‘what he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>seen there made his own work in Westminster Abbey look like
tobacco-pipes.’ You had something of the same sort of feeling with
respect to Mr. Grattan’s artificial and frittered style, after hearing
Mr. Plunkett’s defence of the same side of the question. He went
strait forward to his end with a force equal to his rapidity. He
removed all obstacles, as he advanced. He overturned Mr. Banks
with his right hand, and Mr. Charles Yorke with his left—the one
on a chronological question of the Concordat, and the other as to the
origin of the Corporation and Test Acts. One wonders how they
ever got up again, or trusted themselves on a ground of matter-of-fact
ever after. Mr. Secretary Peele did not offer to put himself in his
way. No part of the subject could come amiss to him—history, law,
constitutional principle, common feeling, local prejudices, general
theory,—all was alike within his reach and his controul. Having
settled one point, he passed on to another, carrying his hearers with
him:—it was as if he knew all that could be said on the question,
and was anxious to impart his knowledge without any desire of shining.
There was no affectation, no effort, but equal ease and earnestness.
Every thing was brought to bear that could answer his purpose, and
there was nothing superfluous. His eloquence swept along like a
river,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Without o’erflowing, full.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Every step told: every sentence went to account. I cannot say that
there was any thing very profound or original in argument, imposing in
imagination, or impassioned in sentiment, in any part of this address—but
it was throughout impregnated with as much thought, imagination
and passion as the House would be likely to understand or sympathise
with. It acted like a loadstone to the feelings of the House; and
the speaker raised their enthusiasm, and carried their convictions as
far as he wished, or as it was practicable. The effect was extraordinary:
the impression grew stronger from first to last. No one
stirred the whole time, and, at the end, the lobbies were crowded
with members going up stairs and saying, ‘Well, this is a speech
worth going without one’s dinner to hear,’ (Oh, unequivocal testimony
of applause!) ‘there has been nothing like this since the
time of Fox,’ etc. For myself, I never heard any other speech that
I would have given three farthings to have made. It did not make
the same figure in the newspapers the next day; for it was but
indifferently reported, owing to the extreme fluency with which it
was delivered. There was no boggling, no straggling, irrelevant
matter;—you could not wait for him at the end of a long parenthesis,
and go on with your report as if nothing had happened in the interval,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>as is sometimes the case,<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c009'><sup>[57]</sup></a>—and besides, for the reason above given,
it was a speech better calculated to strike in the hearing than the
perusal; for though it was fully up to the tone of the House, the
public mind can bear stronger meats. Another such speech would
have decided the question, and made the difference of four votes by
which it was lost. While the impression was fresh in the mind, it
was not easy for any one, pretending to honesty, to look his neighbour
in the face and vote against the motion. But Mr. Plunkett, in
the mean time, sailed for Ireland. Any one who can speak as he
can, and is a friend to his own, or any other country, ought not to let
the present men retain their seats six months longer. Nothing but
the will is wanting.—The ability, I will venture to say, is there.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what shall I say of Lord Castlereagh—that spouter without
beginning, middle, or end—who has not an idea in his head, nor a
word to say for himself—who carries the House of Commons by his
manner alone—who bows and smiles assent and dissent—who makes
a dangling proposition of his person, and is himself a drooping figure
of speech—what shall I say of this inanimate automaton? Nothing!
For what can be said of him?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Come then, expressive silence, muse his praise.’<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c009'><sup>[58]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Neither have I any thing to say of the style of eloquence of Mr.
Alderman Wood, or Mr. Waithman, or Sir. W. Curtis—except
that the latter always appears to me a very fit and lively representative
of the good living, drinking, and eating of the city. This is but
reasonable. The bodies of the city, not their minds, should be represented.
A large turtle in the House (with a proxy to the minister)
would answer the purpose just as well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wilberforce is a speaker whom it is difficult to class either
with ministers or opposition. His character and his pretensions are
altogether equivocal. He is a man of some ability, and, at one time,
had considerable influence. He is what might be called ‘a sweet
speaker’: his silver voice floats and glides up and down in the air, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>if it was avoiding every occasion of offence, and dodging the question
through its various avenues of reason and interest.</p>

      <div class='line'>——‘In many a winding bout</div>
      <div class='line'>Of melting softness long drawn out.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There is a finical flexibility of purpose, and a cautious curiosity of
research, that would put you in pain for him, if the want of proper
self-respect did not take away all common fellow-feeling. His
stratagems are so over-wrought that you wish them to fail: his
evasions are so slippery and yet so palpable that you laugh in his face.
Mr. Wilberforce is a man that has always two strings to his bow: as
an orator, he is a kind of lay-preacher in parliament. He is at
continual <em>hawk and buzzard</em> between character and conscience,
between popularity and court favour, between his loyalty and his
religion, between this world and the next. Is not this something like
trying to serve God and Mammon? He is anxious to stand fair with
the reflecting part of the community, without giving umbrage to power.
He is shocked at vice in low stations:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But ’tis the fall degrades her to a whore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let greatness own her, and she’s mean no more.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He would go with the popular cause as long as it was popular,
and gave him more weight than he lost by it; but would desert it
the instant it became obnoxious, and that an obstinate adherence to it
was likely to deprive him of future opportunities of doing good. He
had rather be on the right side than the wrong, if he loses nothing by
it. His reputation costs him nothing; though he always takes care
to save appearances. His virtues compound for his vices in a very
amicable manner. His humanity is at the horizon, three thousand
miles off,—his servility stays at home, at the beck of the minister.
He unbinds the chains of Africa, and helps (we trust without meaning
it) to rivet those of his own country, and of Europe. As a general
truth,—(not meaning any undue application in the present instance,)
it may be affirmed, that there is not a more insignificant as well as a
dangerous character crawling between heaven and earth, than that of
the pretended patriot, and philanthropist, who has not courage to take
the plain reward of vice or virtue—who crouches to authority, and
yet dreads the censure of the world, who gives a sneaking casting
vote on the side of conscience only when he can do it with impunity,—or
else throws the weight of his reputation into the scale of his
interest and the profligacy of others—who makes an affectation of
principle a stalking-horse to his pitiful desire of distinction, and
betrays a cause, sooner than commit himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>‘Out upon such half-faced fellowship.’ We have another example
of trumpery ambition in the person of Mr. C. Wynne; who,
officious, indefatigable in his petty warfare with the abuses of power,
is chiefly anxious to stand well with those who sanction them. He
interprets the text literally, <em>not to do evil that good may come</em>. He is
so fearful of the imputation of the least wrong, that he will never do
or let any one else do the greatest right. <i><span lang="la">Summum jus summa injuria</span></i>,
has never entered his head. He is the dog in the political manger:
a technical marplot. He takes a systematic delight in giving a lift to
his enemies, and in hampering his friends. He is a regular whipper-in
on the side of opposition, to all those who go but a hairs-breadth
beyond his pragmatical notions of discretion and propriety. He sets
up for a balance-master of the constitution and, by insisting on its
never deviating from its erect, perpendicular position, is sure to have it
overturned. He professes to be greatly scandalized at the abuses and
corruptions in our ancient institutions, which are ‘as notorious as the
sun at noon-day,’ and would have them removed—but he is much
more scandalized at those indiscreet persons who bring to light any of
these notorious abuses, in order to have them remedied. He is more
angry at those with whom he differs in the smallest iota than at
those who differ from him <i><span lang="la">toto cælo</span></i>: and is at mortal enmity with
every antiministerial measure that is not so clogged with imbecility
and objections as to be impracticable or absolutely unavailing. He is
therefore a bad partisan, and does little mischief, only because he is
little attended to. Indeed, his voice is against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>I did not much like Sir Samuel Romilly’s significant, oracular way
of laying down the law in the House:—his self-important assumption
of second-hand truths, and his impatience of contradiction, as if he
gave his time there to humanity for <em>nothing</em>. He was too solemn a
speaker: as Garrow was too flippant and fluent. The latter appeared
to have nothing to do but to talk nonsense <em>by the yard</em>, for the pleasure
of exposing himself or being exposed by others. He might be said
to hold in his hand a general retainer for absurdity, and to hold his
head up in the pillory of his own folly with a very unabashed and
unblushing gaiety of demeanour. Lawyers, as a general rule, are the
very worst speakers in the House: if there are a few nominal
exceptions, it is because they are not lawyers.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not recollect any other speaker of importance but Mr.
Canning; and he requires a chapter by himself. Thus then I would
try to estimate him.—The orator and the writer do not always belong
to the same class of intellectual character; nor is it, I think, in
general, fair to judge of the merit of popular harangues by reducing
them to the standard of literary compositions. Something,—a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>deal,—is to be given to the suddenness of the emergency, the want of
preparation, the instantaneous and effectual, but passing appeal to individual
characters, feelings, and events. The speaker has less time
allowed him to enforce his purpose, and to procure the impression he
aims at than the writer; and he is therefore entitled to produce it by
less scrupulous, by more obvious and fugitive means. He must strike
the iron while it is hot. The blow must be prompt and decisive. He
must mould the convictions and purposes of his hearers while they are
under the influence of passion and circumstances,—as the glass-blower
moulds the vitreous fluid with his breath. If he can take the popular
mind by surprise, and stamp on it, while warm, the impression
desired, it is not to be demanded whether the same means would have
been equally successful on cool reflection or after the most mature
deliberation. That is not the question at issue. At a moment’s
notice the expert debater is able to start some topic, some view of a
subject, which answers the purpose of the moment. He can suggest
a dextrous evasion of his adversaries’ objections, he knows when to
seize and take advantage of the impulse of popular feeling, he is
master of the dazzling fence of argument, ‘the punto, the stoccado,
the reverso,’ the shifts, and quirks, and palpable topics of debate; he
can wield these at pleasure, and employ them to advantage on the
spur of the occasion—this is all that can be required of him; for it
is all that is necessary, and all that he undertakes to do. That
another could bring forward more weighty reasons, offer more wholesome
advice, convey more sound and extensive information in an
indefinite period, is nothing to the purpose; for all this wisdom and
knowledge would be of no avail in the supposed circumstances; the
critical opportunity for action would be lost, before any use could be
made of it. The one thing needful in public speaking is not to say
what is best, but the best that can be said in a given time, place, and
circumstance. The great qualification therefore of a leader in debate
(as of a leader in fight) is presence of mind: he who has not this,
wants every thing, and he who has it, may be forgiven almost all other
deficiencies. The current coin of his discourses may be light and
worthless in itself; but if it is always kept bright and ready for
immediate use, it will pass unquestioned; and the public voice will
affix to his name the praise of a sharp-witted, able, fluent, and eloquent
speaker. We ‘no further seek his merits to disclose, or scan his
frailties in their brief abode,’—the popular ear and echo of popular
applause. What he says may be trite, pert, shallow, contradictory,
false, unfounded, and sophistical; but it was what was wanted for the
occasion, and it told with those who heard it. Let it stop there,
and all is well. The rest is forgotten; nor is it worth remembering.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>But Mr. Canning has an ill habit of printing his speeches: and I
doubt where the same oratorical privileges can be extended to <em>printed</em>
speeches; or to this gentleman’s speeches in general, even though
they should not be printed. Whether afterwards committed to the
press or not, they have evidently, I think, been first committed, with
great care, to paper or to memory. They have all the marks, and
are chargeable with all the <i><span lang="la">malice prepense</span></i> of written compositions.
They are not occasional effusions, but set harangues. They are
elaborate <i><span lang="la">impromptus</span></i>; deeply concerted and highly polished pieces
of extempore ingenuity. The repartee has been conceived many
months before the luckless observation which gives ostensible birth to it;
and an argument woven into a debate is sure to be the counterpart or
fag-end of some worn-out sophism of several years’ standing.
Mr. Canning is not so properly an orator as an author reciting his own
compositions. He foresees (without much of the spirit of prophecy)
what will, may, or can be said on some well-conned subject, and gets
up, by anticipation, a tissue of excellent good conceits, indifferent bad
arguments, classical quotations, and showy similes, which he contrives,
by a sort of rhetorical join-hand, to tack on to some straggling
observation dropped by some Honourable Member,—and so goes on,
with folded arms and sonorous voice, neither quickened nor retarded,
neither elevated nor depressed by the <em>hear him’s</em> that now rise on the
one side, or are now echoed from the other;—never diverted into
laughing gaiety, never hurried into incontrolable passion—till he is
regularly delivered in the course of the same number of hours of the
labour of weeks and months. To those who are in the secret of the
arts of debating, who are versed in the complicated tactics of parliamentary
common-place, there is nothing very mysterious in the
process, though it startles the uninitiated. The fluency, the monotony,
the unimpressible, imposing style of his elocution,—‘swinging slow
with sullen roar,’ like the alternate oscillation of a pendulum—afraid
of being thrown off his balance—never trusting himself with the
smallest inflection of tone or manner from the impulse of the moment,—all
shew that the speaker relies on the tenaciousness of his memory,
not on the quickness and fertility of his invention. Mr. Canning, I
apprehend, never answered a speech: he answers, or affects to answer
some observation in a speech, and then manufactures a long <em>tirade</em> out
of his own ‘mother-wit and arts <em>well-known</em> before.’ He <em>caps</em> an
oration, as school-boys cap verses; and gets up his oracular responses,
as Sidrophel and Whackum did theirs, by having met with his
customers of old. From that time he has the debate entirely in his
own hands, and exercises over it ‘sole sovereign sway and masterdom.’
One of these spontaneous mechanical sallies of his resembles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>a <em>voluntary</em> played on a barrel-organ: it is a kind of Pan-harmonic
display of wit and wisdom—such as Mr. Canning possesses! The
amplest stores of his mind are unfolded to their inmost source—the
classic lore, the historic page, the philosophic doubt, the sage reply,
the sprightly allusion, the delicate irony, the happy turning of a period
or insinuation of a paragraph with senatorial dignity and Ovidian
grace—are all here concocted, studied, revised, varnished over, till
the sense aches at their glossy beauty and sickens at hopeless perfection.
Our modern orator’s thoughts have been declared by some to
have all the elegance of the antique; I should say, they have only the
fragility and smoothness of plaster-cast copies!</p>

<p class='c007'>If I were compelled to characterize Mr. Canning’s style by a
single trait, I should say that he is a mere <em>parodist</em> in verse or prose,
in reasoning or in wit. He transposes arguments as he does images,
and makes sophistry of the one, and burlesque of the other. ‘What’s
serious, he turns to farce.’ This is perhaps, not art in him, so
much as nature. The specific levity of his mind causes it to subsist
best in the rarified atmosphere of indifference and scorn: it attaches
most interest and importance to the slight and worthless. There is
a striking want of solidity and keeping in this person’s character. The
frivolous, the equivocal, is his delight—the element in which he
speaks, and writes, and has his being, as an orator and poet. By
applying to low and contemptible objects the language or ideas which
have been appropriated to high and swelling contemplations, he
reduces the latter to the same paltry level, or renders the former
doubly ridiculous. On the same principle, or from not feeling the
due force and weight of different things, as they affect either the
imagination or the understanding, he brings the slenderest and most
evanescent analogies to bear out the most important conclusions;
establishes some fact in history by giving it the form of an idle interrogation,
like a school-boy declaiming on he knows not what; and
thinks to overturn the fixed sentiment of a whole people by an interjection
of surprise at what he knows to be unavoidable and unanswerable.
There is none of the gravity of the statesman, of the enthusiasm
of the patriot, the impatient zeal of the partizan, in Mr. Canning.
We distinguish through the disguise of pompous declamation, or the
affectation of personal consequence, only the elegant trifler, the
thoughtless epigrammatist, spreading ‘a windy fan of painted plumes,’
to catch the breath of popular applause, or to flutter in the tainted
breeze of court-favour. ‘As those same plumes, so seems he vain
and light,’—never applying his hand to useful action, or his mind to
sober truth. A thing’s being evident, is to him a reason for attempting
to falsify it: its being right is a reason for straining every nerve to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>evade or defeat it at all events. It might appear, that with him inversion
is the order of nature. ‘Trifles light as air, are’ to his
understanding, ‘confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ:’ and he
winks and shuts his apprehension up to the most solemn and momentous
truths as gross and vulgar errors. His political creed is of an
entirely fanciful and fictitious texture—a kind of moral, religious,
political, and sentimental <em>filligre-work</em>: or it is made up of monstrous
pretexts, and idle shadows, and spurious theories, and mock-alarms.
Hence his gravest reasonings have very much an air of concealed
irony; and it might sometimes almost be suspected that, by his partial,
loose, and unguarded sophisms, he meant to abandon the very cause
he professes to magnify and extol.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c009'><sup>[59]</sup></a> It is indeed, his boast, his pride,
his pleasure, ‘to make the worse appear the better reason,’ which he
does with the pertness of a school-boy and the effrontery of a prostitute:
he assumes indecent postures in the debate, confounds the
sense of right and wrong by his licentious disregard of both, puts
honesty out of countenance by the familiarity of his proposals, makes
a jest of principle,—‘takes the rose from the fair forehead of a
virtuous cause, and plants a blister there.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The House of Lords does not at present display much of the
aristocracy of talent. The scene is by no means so amusing or
dramatic here as in the House of Commons. Every speaker seems
to claim his privilege of peerage in the awful attention of his auditors,
which is granted while there is any reasonable hope of a return: but
it is not easy to hear Lord Grenville repeat the same thing regularly
four times over, in different words—to listen to the Marquis of
Wellesley who never lowers his voice for four hours from the time
he begins, nor utters the commonest syllable in a tone below that in
which Pierre curses the Senate—Lord Holland might have other
pretensions to alacrity of mind than an impediment of speech, and
Lord Liverpool might introduce less of the <i><span lang="la">vis inertiæ</span></i> of office into
his official harangues, than he does. Lord Ellenborough was great
‘in the extremity of an oath.’ Lord Eldon, ‘his face ’twixt tears
and smiles contending,’ never loses his place or his temper. It is a
pity to see Lord Erskine sit silent, who was once a popular and
powerful speaker; and when he does get up to speak, you wish he
had said nothing. This nobleman, the other day, on his return to
Scotland after an absence of fifty years, made a striking speech on the
instinctive and indissoluble attachment of all persons to the country
where they are born,—which he considered as an innate and unerring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>principle of the human mind; and, in expatiating on the advantages
of patriotism, argued by way of illustration, that if it were not for this
original dispensation of Providence, attaching, and, as it were, <em>rooting</em>
every one to the spot where he was bred and born,—civil society should
never have existed, nor mankind have been reclaimed from the
barbarous and wandering way of life, to which they were in the first
instance addicted! How these persons should become attached by
habit to places where it appears, from their vagabond dispositions,
they never stayed at all, is an oversight of the speaker which remains
unexplained. On the same occasion, the learned Lord, in order to
produce an effect, observed that when, advancing farther north, he
should come to the old playground near his father’s mansion, where
he used to play at ball when a child, his sensations would be of a most
affecting description. This is possible; but his Lordship returned
homewards the next day, thinking, no doubt, he had anticipated all
the sentiment of the situation. This puts one in mind of the story
one has heard of Tom Sheridan, who told his father he had been
down to the bottom of a coal-pit. ‘Then, you are a fool, Tom,’
said the father. ‘Why so, Sir?’ ‘Because,’ said the other, ‘it
would have answered all the same purpose <em>to have said you had been
down</em>!’</p>

<p class='c007'>‘<cite>Christ’s Agony in the Garden.</cite>—The manner of treating this subject
in the present picture has not been taken from the account of any one
Apostle [Evangelist] in particular, but from the united relations of

<p class='c007'>‘It is wished to give an air of submissive tenderness, while a quiver
of agony still trembles on his features. The Apostles are resting a
little behind, on a sort of garden-bank; St. John in an unsound doze—St.
James in a deep sleep—St. Peter has fallen into a disturbed
slumber against a tree, while keeping guard with his sword, and is on
the point of waking at the approach of light. Behind St. Peter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>stealing round the edge of the bank, comes the mean traitor, Judas,
with a centurion, soldiers, and a crowd; the centurion has stepped
forward from his soldiers (who are marching up) to look with his
torch, where Christ is retired and praying; while Judas, alarmed lest
he might be surprised too suddenly, presses back his hand to enforce
caution and silence, and crouching down his malignant and imbecile
face beneath his shoulders, he crawls forward like a reptile to his
prey, his features shining with the anticipated rapture of successful
treachery.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘It is an inherent feeling in human beings, to rejoice at the instant
of a successful exercise of their own power, however despicably
directed.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The Apostles are supposed to be lit by the glory which emanates
from Christ’s head, and the crowd by the torches and lights about
them.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The printed catalogue contains also elaborate and able descriptions
of Macbeth, the murder of Dentatus, and the judgment of Solomon,
which have been already before the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>We do not think <cite>Christ’s Agony in the Garden</cite> the best picture in
this collection, nor the most striking effort of Mr. Haydon’s pencil.
On the contrary, we must take leave to say, that we consider it as a
comparative failure, both in execution and probable effect. We doubt
whether, in point of policy, the celebrated artist would not have consulted
his reputation and his ultimate interest more, by waiting till he
had produced another work on the same grand and magnificent scale
as his last, instead of trusting to the ebb of popularity, resulting from
the exhibition of Christ’s Entrance into Jerusalem, to float him
through the present season. It is well, it may be argued, to keep
much before the public, since they are apt to forget their greatest
favourites: but they are also fastidious; and it is safest not to appear
always before them in the same, or a less imposing, attitude. It is
better to rise upon them at every step, if possible (and there is yet
room for improvement in our artist’s productions), to take them by
surprise, and compel admiration by new and extraordinary exertions—than
to trust to their generosity or gratitude, to the lingering
remains of their affection for old works, or their candid construction
of some less arduous undertaking. A liberal and friendly critic has,
indeed, declared on this occasion, that if the spirits of great men and
lofty geniuses take delight in the other world, in contemplating what
delighted them in this, then the shades of Raphael, Michael Angelo,
and Correggio, can find no better employment than to descend again
upon the earth, once more teeming with the birth of high art, and
stand with hands crossed, and eyes uplifted in mute wonder, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>Mr. Haydon’s picture of Christ’s Agony in the Garden. If we
believed that the public in general sympathised seriously in this sentiment,
we would not let a murmur escape us to disturb it;—the opinion
of the world, however erroneous, is not easily altered; and if they
are happy in their ignorance, let them remain so;—but if the artist
himself, to whom this august compliment has been paid, should find
the hollowness of such hyperbolical commendation, a hint to him, as
to its cause in the present instance, may not be thrown away. The
public may, and must, be managed to a certain point; that is, a little
noise, and bustle, and officious enthusiasm, is necessary to catch their
notice and fix their attention; but then they should be left to see for
themselves; and after that, an artist should fling himself boldly and
fairly into the huge stream of popularity (as Lord Byron swam across
the Hellespont), stemming the tide with manly heart and hands,
instead of buoying himself up with borrowed bloated bladders, and
flimsy newspaper paragraphs. When a man feels his own strength,
and the public confidence, he has nothing to do but to use the one,
and not abuse the other. As his suspicions of the lukewarmness or
backwardness of the public taste are removed, his jealousy of himself
should increase. The town and the country have shown themselves
willing, eager patrons of Mr. Haydon’s <span class='fss'>AT HOME</span>:—he ought to feel
particular obligations not to invite them by sound of trumpet and beat
of drum to an inferior entertainment; but, like our advertising friend,
Matthews, compass ‘sea, earth, and air,’ to keep up the eclat of his
first and overwhelming <em>accueil</em>! So much for advice; now to
criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said, that we regard the present performance as a comparative
failure; and our reasons are briefly and plainly these following:—First,
this picture is inferior in size to those that Mr. Haydon has
of late years painted, and is so far a falling off. It does not fill a
given <em>stipulated</em> space in the world’s eye. It does not occupy one
side of a great room. It is the Iliad in a nutshell. It is only twelve
feet by nine, instead of nineteen by sixteen; and that circumstance
tells against it with the unenlightened many, and with the judicious
few. One great merit of Mr. Haydon’s pictures is their size.
Reduce him within narrow limits, and you cut off half his resources.
His genius is gigantic. He is of the race of Brobdingnag, and not of
Lilliput. He can manage a groupe better than a single figure: he
can manage ten groupes better than one. He bestrides his art like a
Colossus. The more you give him to do, the better he does it.
Ardour, energy, boundless ambition, are the categories of his mind,
the springs of his enterprises. He only asks ‘ample room and verge
enough.’ Vastness does not confound him, difficulty rouses him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>impossibility is the element in which he glories. He does not concentrate
his powers in a single point, but expands them to the utmost
circumference of his subject, with increasing impetus and rapidity.
He must move great masses, he must combine extreme points, he
must have striking contrasts and situations, he must have all sorts of
characters and expressions; these he hurries over, and dashes in with
a decided, undistracted hand;—set him to finish any one of these to
an exact perfection, to make ‘a hand, an ear, an eye,’ that, in the
words of an old poet, shall be ‘worth an history,’ and his power is
gone. His <em>forte</em> is in motion, not in rest; in complication and sudden
effects, not in simplicity, subtlety, and endless refinement. As it
was said in the Edinburgh Review, Mr. Haydon’s compositions are
masterly sketches;—they are not, as it was said in Blackwood’s
Magazine, finished miniature pictures. We ourselves thought the
Christ in the triumphant Entry into Jerusalem, the least successful
part of that much admired picture: but there it was lost, or borne
along in a crowd of bold and busy figures, in varied or violent actions.
Here it is, not only the principal, but a solitary, and almost the only
important figure: it is thrown in one corner of the picture like a lay-figure
in a painter’s room; the attitude is much like still-life: and the
expression is (in our deliberate judgment) listless, feeble, laboured,
neither expressing the agony of grief, nor the triumph of faith and
resignation over it. It may be, we are wrong: but if so, we cannot
help it. It is evident, however, that this head is painted on a different
principle from that of the Christ last year. It is wrought with care,
and even with precision, in the more detailed outlines: but it is timid,
without relief, and without effect. The colour of the whole figure
is, as if it had been smeared over, and neutralized, with some chalky
tint. It does not stand out from the canvas, either in the general
masses, or in the nicer inflections of the muscles and surface of the
skin. It has a veil over it, not a glory round it. We ought, in
justice, to add, that a black and white copy (we understand by a
young lady) of the head of Christ has a more decided and finer
apparent character. To what can this anomaly be owing? Is it
that Mr. Haydon’s conception and drawing of character is good, but
that his mastery in this respect leaves him, when he resigns the port-crayon;
and that, instead of giving additional force and beauty to the
variations of form and expression, by the aid of colour and real light
and shade, he only <em>smudges</em> them over with the pencil, and leaves the
indications of truth and feeling more imperfect than he found them?
We believe that Mr. Haydon generally copies from nature only with
his port-crayon; and paints from conjecture or fancy. If so, it
would account for what we have here considered as a difficulty. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>have reason to believe that the old painters copied form, colour,—every
thing, to the last syllable,—from nature. Indeed, we have
seen two of the heads in the celebrated Madonna of the Garland, the
Mother, and the fine head of Joseph, as original, finished studies of
heads (the very same as they are in the large composition) in the
collection at Burleigh-house. By the contrary practice, Mr. Haydon,
as it appears to us, has habituated his hand and eye to giving only the
contour of the features or the grosser masses:—when he comes to
the details of those masses, he fails. Some one, we suspect from the
style of this picture, has been advising our adventurous and spirited
artist to try to finish, and he has been taking the advice: we would
advise him to turn back, and consult the natural bent of his own
genius. A man may avoid great faults or absurdities by the suggestion
of friends: he can only attain positive excellence, or overcome
great difficulties, by the unbiassed force of his own mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crowd coming, with Judas at their head, to surprise our
Saviour, is not to our taste. We dislike mobs in a picture. There
is, however, a good deal of bustle and movement in the advancing
group, and it contrasts almost too abruptly with the unimpassioned
stillness and retirement of the figure of Christ. Judas makes a bad
figure both in Mr. Haydon’s catalogue, and on his canvas. We
think the original must have been a more profound and plausible-looking
character than he is here represented. He should not grin and
show his teeth. He was by all accounts, a grave, plodding, calculating
personage, usurious, and with a cast of melancholy, and soon
after went and hanged himself. Had Mr. Haydon been in Scotland
when he made this sketch? Judas was not a laughing, careless wag;
he was one of the ‘Melancholy Andrews.’—The best part of this
picture is decidedly (in our opinion) the middle ground, containing
the figures of the three Apostles. There is a dignity, a grace, a
shadowy repose about them which approaches close indeed upon the
great style in painting. We have only to regret that a person, who
does so well at times, does not do well always. We are inclined to
attribute such inequalities, and an appearance of haste and unconcoctedness
in some of Mr. Haydon’s plans, to distraction and hurry
of mind, arising from a struggle with the difficulties both of art and
of fortune; and as the last of these is now removed, we trust this

<p class='c007'>This is a very proper letter for a lord to write to his bookseller, and
for Mr. Murray to show about among his friends, as it contains some
dry rubs at Mr. Bowles, and some good hits at Mr. Southey and his
‘invariable principles.’ There is some good <em>hating</em>, and some good
writing in it, some coarse jests, and some dogmatical assertions; but
that it is by any means a <em>settler</em> of the question, is what we are in all
due form inclined to doubt. His Lordship, as a poet, is a little
headstrong and self-willed, a spoiled child of nature and fortune: his
philosophy and criticism have a tincture of the same spirit: he doles
out his opinions with a great deal of frankness and spleen, saying,
‘this I like, that I loathe;’ but he does not trouble himself, or the
reader, with his reasons, any more than he accounts to his servants
for the directions he gives them. This might seem too great a compliment
in his Lordship to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this <em>pribble prabble</em> about Pope, and Milton, and Shakspeare,
and what foreigners say of us, and the Venus, and Antinous, and the
Acropolis, and the Grand Canal at Venice, and the Turkish fleet,
and Falconer’s Shipwreck, and ethics, and ethical poetry (with the
single exception of some bold picturesque sketches in the poet’s best
prose-style) is what might be talked by any Bond-street lounger of
them all, after a last night’s debauch, in the intervals between the
splashings of the soda-water and the acid taste of the port wine rising
in the mouth. It is no better than that. If his Lordship had sent
it in from Long’s, or the Albany, to be handed about in Albemarle-street,
in slips as he wrote it, it would have been very well. But all
the way from Ravenna, cannot he contrive to send us something
better than his own ill-humour and our own common-places—than
the discovery that Pope was a poet, and that Cowper was none;
and the old story that Canova, in forming a statue, takes a hand from
one, a foot from another, and a nose from a third, and so makes out
the idea of perfect beauty! (We would advise his Lordship to say
less about this subject of <i><span lang="it">virtù</span></i>, for he knows little about it: and
besides, his perceptions are at variance with his theories.) In truth,
his Lordship has the worst of this controversy, though he throws
out a number of pert, smart, flashy things, with the air of a man who
sees company on subjects of taste, while his reverend antagonist, who
is the better critic and logician of the two, goes prosing on in a tone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>of obsequious pertinacity and sore pleasantry, as if he were sitting
(an unwelcome guest) at his Lordship’s table, and were awed, yet
galled, by the cavalier assumption of patrician manners. We cannot
understand these startling <em>voluntaries</em>, played off before the public on
the ground of personal rank, nor the controversial under-song, like
the drone of a bagpipe that forms a tedious accompaniment to them.
As Jem Belcher, when asked if he did not feel a little awkward at
facing Gamble the tall Irishman, made answer, ‘An please ye, sir,
when I am stript to my shirt, I am afraid of no man;’—so we
would advise Mr. Bowles, in a question of naked argument, to fear
no man, and to let no man bite his thumb at him. If his Lordship
were to invite his brother-poet to his house, and to eke out a sour
jest by the flavour of Monte-Pulciano or Frontiniac,—if in the dearth
of argument he were to ply his friend’s weak side with rich sauces
and well seasoned hospitality, ‘<i><span lang="fr">Ah! ça est bon, ah! goutez ça!</span></i>‘—if
he were to point, in illustration of Pope’s style, to the marble
pillars, the virandas, the pier glasses, the classic busts, the flowering
dessert, and were to exclaim, ‘You see, my dear Bowles, the
superiority of art over nature, the triumph of polished life over Gothic
barbarism: we have here neither the ghosts nor fairies of Shakspeare,
nor Milton’s Heaven, nor <em>his</em> Hell, yet we contrive to do without
them;’—it might require Parson Supple’s command of countenance
to smile off this uncourteous address; but the divine would not have
to digest such awkward raillery on an empty stomach—he would
have his <i><span lang="la">quid pro quo</span></i>: his Lordship would have paid for the liberty
of using his privilege of peerage. But why any man should carry
the <em>rôle</em> of his Lordship’s chaplain out of his Lordship’s house, is
what we see no reason for.—Lord Byron, in the Preface to his
Tragedy, complains that Horace Walpole has had hard measure
dealt him by the critics, ‘firstly, because he was a lord, and secondly,
because he was a gentleman.’ We do not know how the case may
stand between the public and a dead nobleman: but a living lord has
every reasonable allowance made him, and can do what no one else
can. If Lord Byron chooses to make a bad joke, by means of an
ill-spelt pun, it is a condescension in his Lordship:—if he puts off a
set of smart assertions and school-boy instances for pithy proofs, it is
not because he is not able, but because he cannot be at the pains of
going deeper into the question:—if he is rude to an antagonist, it is
construed into agreeable familiarity; any notice from so great a man
appears like a favour:—if he tells or recommends ‘a tale of bawdry,’
he is not to be tied down by the petty rules which restrict common
men:—if he publishes a work, which is thought of too equivocal a
description for the delicate air of Albemarle-street, his Lordship’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>own name in the title-page is sufficient to back it without the formality
of a bookseller’s; if a wire-drawn tragedy of his is acted, in spite
of his protestations against such an appeal to the taste of a vulgar
audience, the storm of pitiless damnation is not let loose upon it,
because it is felt that it would fall harmless on so high and proud a
head; the gilded coronet serves as a conductor to carry off the
lightning of popular criticism, which might blast the merely laurelled
bard; the blame, the disappointment, the flat effect, is thrown upon
the manager, upon the actors—upon any body but the Noble Poet!
This sounding title swells the mouth of Fame, and lends her voice
a thousand circling echoes: the rank of the Author, and the public
charity extended to him, as he does not want it, cover a multitude
of sins. What does his Lordship mean, then by this whining over
the neglect of Horace Walpole,—this uncalled-for sympathy with the
faded lustre of patrician and gentlemanly pretensions? Has <em>he</em> had
only half his fame! Or, does he already feel, with morbid anticipation,
the retiring ebb of that overwhelming tide of popularity, which
having been raised too high by adventitious circumstances, is lost in
flats and shallows, as soon as their influence is withdrawn? Lord
Byron has been twice as much talked of as he would have been, had
he not been Lord Byron. His rank and genius have been happily
placed ‘each other’s beams to share,’ and both together, by their
mutually reflected splendour, may be said to have melted the public
coldness into the very wantonness of praise: the faults of the man
(real or supposed) have only given a dramatic interest to his works.
Whence, then, this repining, this ungracious cavilling, this <em>got up</em> ill-humour?
We load his Lordship with ecstatic admiration, with
unqualified ostentatious eulogies; and he throws them stifling back in
our face: he thanks us with cool, cutting contempt: he asks us for
our voices, ‘our sweet voices,’ like Coriolanus; and, like Coriolanus,
disdains us for the unwholesome gift. Why, then does he ask for
it? If, as a lord, he holds in contempt and abhorrence the willing,
delighted homage, which the public pay to the poet, let him retire
and feed the pride of birth in stately solitude, or take his place among
his equals: but if he does not find this enough, and wants our
wondering tribute of applause to satisfy his craving vanity, and make
him something more than a mere vulgar lord among hundreds of
other lords, why dash the cup of delicious poison, which, at his uneasy
request, we tender him, to the ground, with indignant reckless hands,
and tell us he scorns equally our censure or our praise? If he looks
upon both as equal impertinence, he can easily escape out of the
reach of both by ceasing to write; we shall in that case soon cease to
think of his Lordship: but if he cannot do without our good opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>why affect all this coyness, coldness, and contempt? If he says he
writes not to please us, but to live by us, that only alters the nature
of the obligation, and he might still be civil to Mr. Murray’s
customers. Whether he is independent of public opinion, or dependent
on it, he need not be always sending his readers to Coventry.
When we come to offer him our demonstrations of good will, he
should not kick us down stairs. If he persists in this humour, the
distaste may in time ‘become mutual.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we proceed, there is one thing in which we must say we
heartily agree with Lord Byron; and that is the ridicule with which
he treats Mr. Bowles’s editorial inquisition into the moral character
of Pope. It is a pure piece of clerical priggism. If Pope was not
free from vice, we should like to know who is. He was one of the
most faultless of poets, both in his life and in his writings. We
should not care to throw the first stone at him. We do not wonder
at Lord Byron’s laughing outright at Mr. Bowles’s hysterical horrors
at poor Pope’s platonic peccadillos, nor at his being a little impatient
of the other’s attempt to make himself a <em>make-believe</em> character of
perfection out of the ‘most small faults’ he could rake up against the
reputation of an author, whom he was bound either not to edite or
not to injure. But we think his Lordship turns the tables upon the
divine, and gets up into the reading desk himself, without the proper
canonical credentials, when he makes such a fuss as he does about
didactic or moral poetry as the highest of all others, because moral
truth and moral conduct are of such vast and paramount concernment
in human life. But because they are such good things in themselves,
does it follow that they are the better for being put into rhyme? We
see no connection between ‘ends of verse, and sayings of philosophers.’
This reasoning reminds us of the critic who said, that the only
poetry he knew of, good for any thing, was the four lines, beginning
‘Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November,’ for that
these were really of some use in finding out the number of days in
the different months of the year. The rules of arithmetic are important
in many respects, but we do not know that they are the fittest
subjects of poetry. Besides, Pope was not the only moral poet, nor
are we sure that we understand his moral system, or that Lord Byron
understands it, or that he understood it himself. Addison paraphrased
the Psalms, and Blackmore sung the Creation: yet Pope has written
a lampoon upon the one, and put the other in his Dunciad.
Mr. Bowles has numbers of manuscript sermons by him, the morality
of which, we will venture to say, is quite as pure, as orthodox, as that
of the unpublished cantos of Don Juan; yet we doubt whether
Mr. Murray, the Mecænas of poetry and orthodoxy, would give as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>much for the one as for the other. We do not look for the flowers
of fancy in moral treatises, nor for a homily in his Lordship’s
irregular stanzas. The Decalogue, as a practical prose composition,
or as a body of moral laws and precepts, is of sufficient weight and
authority; but we should not regard the putting this into heroic
verse, as an effort of the highest poetry. That ‘Sternhold and
Hopkins had great qualms’ is no imputation on the pious raptures of
the Hebrew bard: and we suspect his Lordship himself would object
to the allegory in Spenser, as a drawback on the poetry, if it is in
other respects to his Lordship’s taste, which is more than we can
pretend to determine. The Noble Letter-writer thus moralizes on
this subject and transposes the ordinary critical canons somewhat
arbitrarily and sophistically.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The depreciation of Pope is partly founded upon a false idea of
the dignity of his order of poetry, to which he has partly contributed
by the ingenuous boast,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That not in Fancy’s maze he wander’d long,</div>
      <div class='line'>But <em>stoop’d</em> to Truth, and moraliz’d his song.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘He should have written “rose to truth.” In my mind the highest
of all poetry is ethical poetry, as the highest of all earthly objects
must be moral truth. Religion does not make a part of my subject;
it is something beyond human hands except Milton’s and Dante’s,
and even Dante’s powers are involved in his delineation of human
passions, though in supernatural circumstances. What made Socrates
the greatest of men? His moral truth—his ethics. What proved
Jesus Christ the Son of God hardly less than his miracles? His
moral precepts. And if ethics have made a philosopher the first of
men, and have not been disdained as an adjunct to his Gospel by the
Deity himself, are we to be told that ethical poetry, or didactic
poetry, or by whatever name you term it, whose object is to make
men better and wiser, is not the <em>very first order</em> of poetry; and are
we to be told this too by one of the priesthood? It requires more
mind, more wisdom, more power, than all the “forests” that ever
were “walked” for their “description,” and all the epics that ever
were founded upon fields of battle. The Georgics are indisputably,
and, I believe, <em>undisputedly</em>, even a finer poem than the Æneid.
Virgil knew this: he did not order <em>them</em> to be burnt.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The proper study of mankind is man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘It is the fashion of the day to lay great stress upon what they call
“imagination” and “invention,”—the two commonest of qualities:
an Irish peasant, with a little whiskey in his head, will imagine and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>invent more than would furnish forth a modern poem. If Lucretius
had not been spoiled by the Epicurean system, we should have had
a far superior poem to any now in existence. As mere poetry, it is
the first of Latin poems. What then has ruined it? His ethics.
Pope has not this defect: his moral is as pure as his poetry is
glorious.’ P. 42.</p>

<p class='c007'>Really this is very inconsequential, incongruous reasoning. An
Irish peasant, with a little whiskey in his head, would not fall upon
more blunders, contradictions, and defective conclusions. Lord
Byron talks of the ethical systems of Socrates and Jesus Christ.
What made the former the great man he supposes?—The invention
of his system—the discovery of sublime moral truths. Does Lord
Byron mean to say, that the mere repetition of the same precepts in
prose, or the turning them into verse, will make others as great, or
will make a great man at all? The two things compared are wholly
disparates. The finding out the 48th proposition in Euclid made
Pythagoras a great man. Shall we say that the putting this into a
grave, didactic distich would make either a great mathematician or a
great poet? It would do neither one nor the other; though,
according to Lord Byron, this distich would belong to the highest
class of poetry, ‘because it would do that in verse, which one of the
greatest of men had wished to accomplish in prose.’ Such is the way
in which his Lordship transposes the common sense of the question,—because
it is his humour! The value of any moral truth depends
on the philosophic invention implied in it. But this rests with the
first author, and the general idea, which forms the basis of didactic
poetry, remains the same, through all its mechanical transmissions
afterwards. The merit of the ethical poet must therefore consist in
his manner of adorning and illustrating a number of these general
truths which are not his own, that is, in the poetical invention and
imagination he brings to the subject, as Mr. Bowles has well shown,
with respect to the episodes in the Essay on Man, the description of
the poor Indian and the lamb doomed to death, which are all the
unsophisticated reader ever remembers of that much-talked-of production.
Lord Byron clownishly chooses to consider all poetry but
what relates to this ethical or didactic truth as ‘a lie.’ Is Lear a lie?
Or does his Lordship prefer the story, or the moral, in Æsop’s
Fables? He asks ‘why must the <em>poet</em> mean the <em>liar</em>, the <em>feigner</em>, the
<em>tale-teller</em>? A man may make and create better things than these.’—He
may make and create better things than a common-place, and he
who does not, makes and creates nothing. The ethical or didactic
poet necessarily repeats after others, because general truths and
maxims are limited. The individual instances and illustrations, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>his Lordship qualifies as ‘lies,’ ‘feigning,’ and ‘tale-telling,’ are
infinite, and give endless scope to the genius of the true poet. The
rank of poetry is to be judged of by the truth and purity of the moral—so
we find it ‘in the bond,’—and yet Cowper, we are told, was no
poet. Is there any keeping in this, or is it merely an air? Again,
we are given to understand that didactic poetry ‘requires more mind,
more power than all the descriptive or epic poetry that ever was
written:’ and as a proof of this, his Lordship lays it down, that the
Georgics are a finer poem than the Æneid. We do not perceive the
inference here. ‘Virgil knew this: he did not order <em>them</em> to be
burnt.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The proper study of mankind is man.”’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Does our author mean that this was Virgil’s reason for liking his
pastoral poetry better than his description of Dido and Æneas?
But farther, there is a Latin poem (that of Lucretius) superior even
to the Georgics; nay, it would have been so to any poem now in
existence, but for one unlucky circumstance. And what is that?
‘Its ethics!’ So that ethics have spoiled the finest poem in the
world. This is the rub that makes didactic poetry come in such a
questionable shape. If original, like Lucretius, there will be a difference
of opinion about it. If trite and acknowledged, like Pope,
however pure, there will be little valuable in it. It is the glory and
the privilege of poetry to be conversant about those truths of nature
and the heart that are at once original and self-evident. His Lordship
ought to <em>have known this</em>. In the same passage, he speaks of
imagination and invention as ‘the two commonest of qualities.’ We
will tell his Lordship what is commoner, the want of them. ‘An
Irish peasant,’ he adds, ‘with a little whiskey in his head, will
imagine and invent more than’—(What? Homer, Spenser, and
Ariosto? No: but than)—‘would furnish forth a modern poem.’
That we will not dispute. But at any rate, when sober next morning,
he would be as ‘full of wise saws and modern instances’ as his
Lordship; and in either case, equally positive, tetchy, and absurd!</p>

<p class='c007'>His Lordship, throughout his pamphlet, makes a point of contradicting
Mr. Bowles, and, it would seem, of contradicting himself.
He cannot be said to have any opinions of his own, but whatever any
one else advances, he denies out of mere spleen and rashness. ‘He
hates the word <em>invariable</em>,’ and not without reason. ‘What is there
of human, be it poetry, philosophy, wit, wisdom, science, power,
glory, mind, matter, life, or death, which is invariable?’ There is
one of the particulars in this enumeration, which seems pretty invariable,
which is death. One would think that the principles of poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>are so too, notwithstanding his peevish disclaimer: for towards the
conclusion of this letter he sets up Pope as a classic model, and considers
all modern deviations from it as grotesque and barbarous.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘They have raised a mosque by the side of a Grecian temple of the
purest architecture; and, more barbarous than the barbarians from
whose practice I have borrowed the figure, they are not contented
with their own grotesque edifice, unless they destroy <em>the prior and
purely beautiful fabric which preceded</em>,<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c009'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and which shames them and
theirs for ever and ever.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Byron has here substituted his own invariable principles for
Mr. Bowles’s, which he hates as bad as Mr. Southey’s variable
politics. Will nothing please his Lordship—neither dull fixtures nor
shining weather-cocks?—We might multiply instances of a want of
continuous reasoning, if we were fond of this sort of petty cavilling.
Yet we do not know that there is any better quarry in the book.
Why does his Lordship tell us that ‘ethical poetry is the highest of
all poetry,’ and yet that ‘Petrarch the sonnetteer’ is esteemed by
good judges the very highest poet of Italy? Mr. Bowles is a sonnetteer,
and a very good one. Why does he assert that ‘the poet who
executes the best is the highest, whatever his department,’ and then
affirm in the next page that didactic poetry ‘requires more mind,
more wisdom, more power than all the forests that ever were walked
for their description;’ and then again, two pages after, that ‘a good
poet can make a silk purse of a sow’s ear;’ that is, as he interprets
it, ‘can imbue a pack of cards with more poetry than inhabits the
forests of America?’ That’s a <i><span lang="la">Non Sequitur</span></i>, as Partridge has it.
Why, contending that all subjects are alike indifferent to the genuine
poet, does he turn round upon himself, and assume that ‘the sun
shining upon a warming-pan cannot be made sublime or poetical?’
Why does he say that ‘there is nothing in nature like the bust of the
Antinous, except the Venus,’ which is not in nature?<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c009'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Why does
he call the first ‘that wonderful <em>creation</em> of perfect beauty,’ when it is
a mere portrait, and on that account so superior to his favourite coxcomb,
the Apollo? Why does he state that ‘more poetry cannot be
gathered into existence’ than we here see, and yet that this poetry
arises neither from nature nor moral exaltedness; Mr. Bowles and
he being at issue on this very point, viz. the one affirming that the
essence of poetry is derived from nature, and his Lordship, that it
consists in moral truth? Why does he consider a shipwreck as an
artificial incident? Why does he make the excellence of Falconer’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>Shipwreck consist in its technicalities, and not in its faithful description
of common feelings and inevitable calamity? Why does he say
all this, and much more, which he should not? Why does he write
prose at all? Yet, in spite of all this trash, there is one passage for
which we forgive him, and here it is.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The truth is, that in these days the grand <i><span lang="la">primum mobile</span></i> of England
is <em>cant</em>: cant political, cant poetical, cant religious, cant moral;
but always cant, multiplied through all the varieties of life. It is the
fashion, and while it lasts, will be too powerful for those who can
only exist by taking the tone of the times. I say <em>cant</em>, because it is
a thing of words, without the smallest influence upon human actions;
the English being no wiser, no better, and much poorer, and more
divided among themselves, as well as far less moral, than they were
before the prevalence of this verbal decorum.’ These words should
be written in letters of gold, as the testimony of a lofty poet to a
great moral truth, and we can hardly have a quarrel with the writer
of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three questions which form the subject of the present
pamphlet; viz. What is poetical? What is natural? What is artificial?
And we get an answer to none of them. The controversy,
as it is carried on between the chief combatants, is much like a dispute
between two artists, one of whom should maintain that blue is the
only colour fit to paint with, and the other that yellow alone ought
ever to be used. Much might be said on both sides, but little to the
purpose. Mr. Campbell leads off the dance, and launches a ship as
a beautiful and poetical artificial object. But he so loads it with
patriotic, natural, and foreign associations, and the sails are ‘so perfumed
that the winds are love-sick,’ that Mr. Bowles darts upon and
seizes it as contraband to art, swearing that it is no longer the work
of the shipwright, but of Mr. Campbell’s lofty poetic imagination;
and dedicates its stolen beauty to the right owners, the sun, the winds,
and the waves. Mr. Campbell, in his eagerness to make all sure,
having overstepped the literal mark, presses no farther into the controversy;
but Lord Byron, who is ‘like an Irishman in a row, <em>any
body’s customer</em>,’ carries it on with good polemical hardihood, and runs
a very edifying parallel between the ship without the sun, the winds,
and waves,—and the sun, the winds, and waves without the ship.
‘The sun,’ says Mr. Bowles, ‘is poetical, by your Lordship’s admission.’
We think it would have been so without it. But his Lordship
contends that ‘the sun would no longer be poetical, if it did not
shine on ships, or pyramids, or fortresses, and other works of art,’
(he expressly excludes ‘footmen’s liveries’ and ‘brass warming-pans’
from among those artificial objects that reflect new splendour on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>eye of Heaven)—to which Mr. Bowles replies, that let the sun but
shine, and ‘it is poetical <i><span lang="la">per se</span></i>,’ in which we think him right. His
Lordship decompounds the wind into a <i><span lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of poetry, by
making it howl through a pig-stye, instead of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Roaming the illimitable ocean wide;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and turns a water-fall, or a clear spring, into a slop-basin, to prove
that nature owes its elegance to art. His Lordship is ‘ill at these
numbers.’ Again, he affirms that the ruined temple of the Parthenon
is poetical, and the coast of Attica with Cape Colonna, and the
recollection of Falconer’s Shipwreck, classical. Who ever doubted
it? What then? Does this prove that the Rape of the Lock is
not a mock-heroic poem? He assures us that a storm with cockboats
scudding before it is interesting, particularly if this happens to
take place in the Hellespont, over which the noble critic swam; and
makes it a question, whether the dark cypress groves, or the white
towers and minarets of Constantinople are more impressive to the
imagination? What has this to do with Pope’s grotto at Twickenham,
or the boat in which he paddled across the Thames to Kew? Lord
Byron tells us (and he should know) that the Grand Canal at Venice
is a muddy ditch, without the stately palaces by its side; but then it
is a natural, not an artificial canal; and finally, he asks, what would
the desert of Tadmor be without the ruins of Palmyra, or Salisbury
Plain without Stone-Henge? Mr. Bowles who, though tedious and
teasing, has ‘damnable iteration in him,’ and has read the Fathers,
answers very properly, by saying that a desert alone ‘conveys ideas
of immeasurable distance, of profound silence, of solitude;’ and that
Salisbury Plain has the advantage of Hounslow Heath, chiefly in
getting rid of the ideas of artificial life, ‘carts, caravans, raree-show-men,
butchers’ boys, coaches with coronets, and livery servants
behind them,’ even though Stone-Henge did not lift its pale head
above its barren bosom. Indeed, Lord Byron’s notions of art and
poetry are sufficiently wild, romantic, far-fetched, obsolete: his taste
is Oriental, Gothic; his Muse is not domesticated; there is nothing
<em>mimminee-pimminee</em>, modern, polished, light, fluttering, in his standard
of the sublime and beautiful: if his thoughts are proud, pampered,
gorgeous, and disdain to mingle with the objects of humble, unadorned
nature, his lordly eye at least ‘keeps distance due’ from the vulgar
vanities of fashionable life; from drawing-rooms, from card-parties,
and from courts. He is not a carpet poet. He does not sing the
sofa, like poor Cowper. He is qualified neither for poet-laureate nor
court-newsman. He is at issue with the Morning Post and Fashionable
World, on what constitutes the true pathos and sublime of human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>life. He hardly thinks Lady Charlemont so good as the Venus, or
as an Albanian girl, that he saw mending the road in the mountains.
If he does not like flowers and forests, he cares as little for stars,
garters, and prince’s feathers, for diamond necklaces and paste buckles.
If his Lordship cannot make up his mind to the quiet, the innocence,
the simple, unalterable grandeur of nature, we are sure that he hates
the frippery, the foppery, and pert grimace of art, quite as much.
His Lordship likes the poetry, the imaginative part of art, and so do
we; and so we believe did the late Mr. John Scott. He likes the
<i><span lang="fr">sombre</span></i> part of it, the thoughtful, the decayed, the ideal, the spectral
shadow of human greatness, the departed spirit of human power.
He sympathizes not with art as a display of ingenuity, as the triumph
of vanity or luxury, as it is connected with the idiot, superficial, petty
self-complacency of the individual and the moment, (these are to him
not ‘luscious as locusts, but bitter as coloquintida’); but he sympathizes
with the triumphs of Time and Fate over the proudest works
of man—with the crumbling monuments of human glory—with the
dim vestiges of countless generations of men—with that which claims
alliance with the grave, or kindred with the elements of nature.
This is what he calls art and artificial poetry. But this is not what
any body else understands by the terms, commonly or critically
speaking. There is as little connexion between the two things as
between the grand-daughters of Mr. Coutts, who appeared at court
the other day, and Lady Godiva—as there is between a reigning
toast and an Egyptian mummy. Lord Byron, through the whole
of the argument, pelts his reverend opponent with instances, like
throwing a stone at a dog, which the incensed animal runs after,
picks up, mumbles between his teeth, and tries to see what it is
made of. The question is, however, too tough for Mr. Bowles’s
powers of mastication, and though the fray is amusing, nothing comes
of it. Between the Editor of Pope, and the Editor of the New
Monthly Magazine, his Lordship sits</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>‘——high arbiter,</div>
      <div class='line'>And by decision more embroils the fray.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>What is the use of taking a work of art, from which ‘all the art of
art is flown’ a mouldering statue, or a fallen column in Tadmor’s
marble waste, that staggers and over-awes the mind, and gives birth
to a thousand dim reflections, by seeing the power and pride of man
prostrate, and laid low in the dust; what is there in this to prove
the self-sufficiency of the upstart pride and power of man? A Ruin
is poetical. Because it is a work of art, says Lord Byron. No, but
because it is a work of art o’erthrown. In it we see, as in a mirror,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>the life, the hopes, the labour of man defeated, and crumbling away
under the slow hand of time; and all that he has done reduced to
nothing, or to a useless mockery. Or as one of the bread-and-butter
poets has described the same thing a little differently, in his tale of
Peter Bell the potter,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘——The stones and tower</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d fading fast away</div>
      <div class='line'>From human thoughts and purposes,</div>
      <div class='line'>To yield to some transforming power,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blend with the surrounding trees.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>If this is what Lord Byron means by artificial objects and interests,
there is an end of the question, for he will get no critic, no school to
differ with him. But a fairer instance would be a snug citizen’s box
by the road side, newly painted, plastered and furnished, with every
thing in the newest fashion and gloss, not an article the worse for
wear, and a lease of one-and-twenty years to run, and then let us see
what Lord Byron, or his friend and ‘host of human life’ will make
of it, compared with the desolation, and the waste of all these
comforts, arts, and elegances. Or let him take—not the pyramids
of Egypt, but the pavilion at Brighton, and make a poetical description
of it in prose or verse. We defy him. The poetical interest,
in his Lordship’s transposed cases, arises out of the imaginary interest.
But the truth is, that where art flourishes and attains its object, imagination
droops, and poetry along with it. It ceases, or takes a different
and ambiguous shape; it may be elegant, ingenious, pleasing, instructive,
but if it aspires to the semblance of a higher interest, or the
ornaments of the highest fancy, it necessarily becomes burlesque,
as for instance, in the Rape of the Lock. As novels end with
marriage, poetry ends with the consummation and success of art.
And the reason (if Lord Byron would attend to it) is pretty obvious.
Where all the wishes and wants are supplied, anticipated by art,
there can be no strong cravings after ideal good, nor dread of unimaginable
evils; the sources of terror and pity must be dried up:
where the hand has done every thing, nothing is left for the imagination
to do or to attempt: where all is regulated by conventional
indifference, the full workings, the involuntary, uncontrollable emotions
of the heart cease: property is not a poetical, but a practical prosaic
idea, to those who possess and clutch it; and cuts off others from
cordial sympathy; but nature is common property, the unenvied idol
of all eyes, the fairy ground where fancy plays her tricks and feats;
and the passions, the workings of the heart (which Mr. Bowles very
properly distinguishes from manners, inasmuch as they are not in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>power of the will to regulate or satisfy) are still left as a subject for
something very different from didactic or mock-heroic poetry. By
<em>art</em> and <em>artificial</em>, as these terms are applied to poetry or human life,
we mean those objects and feelings which depend for their subsistence
and perfection on the will and arbitrary conventions of man and
society; and by nature, and natural subjects, we mean those objects
which exist in the universe at large, without, or in spite of, the
interference of human power and contrivance, and those interests
and affections which are not amenable to the human will. That we
are to exclude art, or the operation of the human will, from poetry
altogether, is what we do not affirm; but we mean to say, that where
this operation is the most complete and manifest, as in the creation of
given objects, or regulation of certain feelings, there the spring of
poetry, <em>i.e.</em> of passion and imagination, is proportionably and much
impaired. We are masters of Art, Nature is our master; and it is
to this greater power that we find working above, about, and within
us, that the genius of poetry bows and offers up its highest homage.
If the infusion of art were not a natural disqualifier for poetry, the
most artificial objects and manners would be the most poetical: on
the contrary, it is only the rude beginnings, or the ruinous decay of
objects of art, or the simplest modes of life and manners, that admit
of, or harmonize kindly with, the tone and language of poetry. To
consider the question otherwise, is not to consider it too curiously,
but not to understand it at all. Lord Byron talks of Ulysses striking
his horse Rhesus with his bow, as an instance of the heroic in poetry.
But does not the poetical dignity of the instrument arise from its very
commonness and simplicity? A bow is not a supererogation of the
works of art. It is almost peculiar to a state of nature, that is, the
first and rudest state of society. Lord Byron might as well talk
of a shepherd’s crook, or the garland of flowers with which he
crowns his mistress, as images borrowed from artificial life. He
cannot make a gentleman-usher’s rod poetical, though it is the pink
of courtly and gentlemanly refinement. Will the bold stickler for
the artificial essence of poetry translate Pope’s description of Sir
Plume,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of amber-headed snuff-box justly vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the nice conduct of a clouded cane,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>into the same sort of poetry as Homer’s description of the bow of
Ulysses? It is out of the question. The very mention of the last
has a sound with it like the twang of the bow itself; whereas the
others, the snuff-box and clouded cane, are of the very essence of
effeminate impertinence. Pope says, in Spence’s Anecdotes, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>‘a lady of fashion would admire a star, because it would remind her
of the twinkling of a lamp on a ball-night.’ This is a much better
account of his own poetry than his noble critic has given. It is a
clue to a real solution of the difficulty. What is the difference
between the feeling with which we contemplate a gas light in one of
the squares, and the crescent moon beside it, but this—that though
the brightness, the beauty perhaps, to the mere sense, is the same or
greater; yet we know that when we are out of the square we shall
lose sight of the lamp, but that the moon will lend us its tributary
light wherever we go; it streams over green valley or blue ocean
alike; it is hung up in air, a part of the pageant of the universe; it
steals with gradual, softened state into the soul, and hovers, a fairy
apparition, over our existence! It is this which makes it a more
poetical object than a patent lamp, or a Chinese lanthorn, or the
chandelier at Covent-garden, brilliant as it is, and which, though it
were made ten times more so, would still only dazzle and scorch
the sight so much the more; it would not be attended with a mild
train of reflected glory; it would ‘denote no foregone conclusion,’
would touch no chord of imagination or the heart; it would have
nothing romantic about it.—A man can make any thing, but he
cannot make a sentiment! It is a thing of inveterate prejudice, of
old association, of common feelings, and so is poetry, as far as it is
serious. A ‘pack of cards,’ a silver bodkin, a paste buckle, ‘may
be imbued’ with as much mock poetry as you please, by lending
false associations to it; but real poetry, or poetry of the highest
order, can only be produced by unravelling the real web of associations,
which have been wound round any subject by nature, and the
unavoidable conditions of humanity. Not to admit this distinction at
the threshold, is to confound the style of Tom Thumb with that
of the Moor of Venice, or Hurlothrumbo with the Doge of Venice.
It is to mistake jest for earnest, and one thing for another.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How far that little candle throws its beams!</div>
      <div class='line'>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The image here is one of artificial life; but it is connected with
natural circumstances and romantic interests, with darkness, with
silence, with distance, with privation, and uncertain danger: it is
common, obvious, without pretension or boast, and therefore the
poetry founded upon it is natural, because the feelings are so. It is
not the splendour of the candle itself, but the contrast to the gloom
without,—the comfort, the relief it holds out from afar to the
benighted traveller,—the conflict between nature and the first and
cheapest resources of art, that constitutes the romantic and imaginary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>that is, the poetical interest, in that familiar but striking image.
There is more art in the lamp or chandelier; but for that very
reason, there is less poetry. A light in a watch-tower, a beacon at
sea, is sublime for the same cause; because the natural circumstances
and associations set it off; it warns us against danger, it reminds us
of common calamity, it promises safety and hope: it has to do with
the broad feelings and circumstances of human life, and its interest
does not assuredly turn upon the vanity or pretensions of the maker
or proprietor of it. This sort of art is co-ordinate with nature, and
comes into the first-class of poetry, but no one ever dreamt of the
contrary. The features of nature are great leading landmarks, not
near and little, or confined to a spot, or an individual claimant; they
are spread out everywhere the same, and are of universal interest.
The true poet has therefore been described as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Creation’s tenant, he is nature’s heir.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>What has been thus said of the man of genius might be said of the
man of no genius. The spirit of poetry, and the spirit of humanity
are the same. The productions of nature are not locked up in the
cabinets of the curious, but spread out on the green lap of earth.
The flowers return with the cuckoo in the spring: the daisy for ever
looks bright in the sun; the rainbow still lifts its head above the
storm to the eye of infancy or age—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>‘So was it when my life began;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So is it now I am a man,</div>
      <div class='line'>So shall it be till I grow old and die;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>but Lord Byron does not understand this, for he does not understand
Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry, and we cannot make him. His Lordship’s
nature, as well as his poetry, is something arabesque and outlandish.—Again,
once more, what, we would ask, makes the difference
between an opera of Mozart’s, and the singing of a thrush confined
in a wooden cage at the corner of the street in which we live? The
one is nature, and the other is art: the one is paid for, and the other
is not. Madame Fodor sings the air of <cite>Vedrai Carino</cite> in <cite>Don
Giovanni</cite> so divinely, because she is hired to sing it; she sings it to
please the audience, not herself, and does not always like to be <em>encored</em>
in it; but the thrush that awakes us at daybreak with its song, does
not sing because it is paid to sing, or to please others, or to be admired
or criticised. It sings because it is happy: it pours the thrilling
sounds from its throat, to relieve the overflowings of its own breast—the
liquid notes come from, and go to, the heart, dropping balm into
it, as the gushing spring revives the traveller’s parched and fainting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>lips. That stream of joy comes pure and fresh to the longing sense,
free from art and affectation, the same that rises over vernal groves,
mingled with the breath of morning, and the perfumes of the wild
hyacinth; that waits for no audience, that wants no rehearsing, that
exhausts its raptures, and still—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hymns its good God, and carols sweet of love.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There is this great difference between nature and art, that the one <em>is</em>
what the other <em>seems</em>, and gives all the pleasure it expresses, because
it feels it itself. Madame Fodor sings, as a musical instrument may
be made to play a tune, and perhaps with no more real delight: but
it is not so with the linnet or the thrush, that sings because God
pleases, and pours out its little soul in pleasure. This is the reason
why its singing is (so far) so much better than melody or harmony,
than base or treble, than the Italian or the German School, than
quavers or crotchets, or half-notes, or canzonets, or quartetts, or any
thing in the world but truth and nature!</p>

<p class='c007'>To give one more instance or two of what we understand by a
natural interest ingrafted on artificial objects, and of the principle that
still keeps them distinct. Amelia’s ‘hashed mutton’ in Fielding, is
one that I might mention. Hashed mutton is an article in cookery,
homely enough in the scale of art, though far removed from the
simple products of nature; yet we should say that this common
delicacy which Amelia provided for her husband’s supper, and then
waited so long in vain for his return, is the foundation of one of the
most natural and affecting incidents in one of the most natural and
affecting books in the world. No description of the most splendid
and luxurious banquet could come up to it. It will be remembered,
when the <cite>Almanach des Gourmands</cite>, and even the article on it in the
last Edinburgh Review, are forgotten. Did Lord Byron never read
Boccacio? We wish he would learn refinement from him, and get
rid of his hard <i><span lang="it">bravura</span></i> taste, and swashbuckler conclusions. What
makes the charm of the Story of the Falcon? Is it properly art or
nature? The tale is one of artificial life, and elegant manners, and
chivalrous pretensions; but it is the fall from these, the decline into
the vale of low and obscure poverty,—the having but one last loop
left to hang life on, and the sacrifice of that to a feeling still more
precious, and which could only give way with life itself,—that
elevates the sentiment, and has made it find its way into all hearts.
Had Frederigo Alberigi had an aviary of Hawks, and preserves of
pheasants without end, he and his poor bird would never have been
heard of. It is not the expence and ostentation of the entertainment
he set before his mistress, but the prodigality of affection, squandering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>away the last remains of his once proud fortunes, that stamps this
beautiful incident on the remembrance of all who have ever read it.
We wish Lord Byron would look it over again, and see whether it
does not most touch the chords of pathos and sentiment in those places
where we feel the absence of all the pomp and vanities of art. Mr.
Campbell talks of a ship as a sublime and beautiful object in art.
We will confess we always stop to look at the mail-coaches with no
slight emotion, and, perhaps, extend our hands after some of them, in
sign of gratulation. They carry the letters of friends, of relations;
they keep up the communication between the heart of a country. We
do not admire them for their workmanship, for their speed, for their
livery—there is something more in it than this. Perhaps we can
explain it by saying, that we once heard a person observe—‘I always
look at the Shrewsbury mail, and sometimes with tears in my eyes:
that is the coach that will bring me the news of the death of my
father and mother.’ His Lordship will say, the mail-coach is an
artificial object. Yet we think the interest here was not founded upon
that circumstance. There was a finer and deeper link of affection
that did not depend on the red painted pannels, or the <em>dyed garments</em>
of the coachman and guard. At least it strikes us so.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not an easy subject to illustrate, and it is still more difficult
to define. Yet we shall attempt something of the sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Natural objects are common and obvious, and are imbued with
an habitual and universal interest, without being vulgar. Familiarity
in them does not breed contempt, as it does in the works of man.
They form an ideal class; their repeated impression on the mind, in
so many different circumstances, grows up into a sentiment. The
reason is, that we refer them generally and collectively to ourselves,
as links and mementos of our various being; whereas, we refer the
works of art respectively to those by whom they are made or to whom
they belong. This distracts the mind in looking at them, and gives
a petty and unpoetical character to what we feel relating to them.
When the works of art become poetical, it is when they are emancipated
from this state of ‘circumscription and confine,’ by some
circumstance that sets aside the idea of property and individual
distinction. The sound of village bells,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——The poor man’s only music,’<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c009'><sup>[63]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>excites as lively an interest in the mind, as the warbling of a thrush:
the sight of a village spire presents nothing discordant with the
surrounding scenery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>2. Natural objects are more akin to poetry and the imagination,
partly because they are not our own handy-work, but start up
spontaneously, like a visionary creation, of their own accord, without
our knowledge or connivance.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The earth hath bubbles, as the water hath,</div>
      <div class='line'>And these are of them;—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and farther, they have this advantage over the works of art, that the
latter either fall short of their preconceived intention, and excite our
disgust and disappointment by their defects; or, if they completely
answer their end, they then leave nothing to the imagination, and so
excite little or no romantic interest that way. A Count Rumford
stove, or a Dutch oven, are useful for the purposes of warmth or
culinary dispatch. Gray’s purring favourite would find great comfort
in warming its nose before the one, or dipping its whiskers in the
other; and so does the artificial animal, man: but the poetry of
Rumford grates or Dutch ovens, it would puzzle even Lord Byron
to explain. Cowper has made something of the ‘loud-hissing urn,’
though Mr. Southey, as being one of the more refined ‘naturals,’
still prefers ‘the song of the kettle.’ The more our senses, our self-love,
our eyes and ears, are surrounded, and, as it were, saturated
with artificial enjoyments and costly decorations, the more the avenues
to the imagination and the heart are unavoidably blocked up. We
do not say, that this may not be an advantage to the individual; we
say it is a disadvantage to the poet. Even ‘Mine Host of Human
Life’ has felt its palsying, enervating influence. Let any one (after
ten years old) take shelter from a shower of rain in Exeter Change,
and see how he will amuse the time with looking over the trinkets,
the chains, the seals, the curious works of art. Compare this with
the description of Una and the Red Cross Knight in Spenser:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Enforc’d to seek some covert nigh at hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>A shady grove not far away they spied,</div>
      <div class='line'>That promis’d aid the tempest to withstand:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose lofty trees, yclad with summer’s pride,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did spread so broad, that heaven’s light did hide,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not pierceable with power of any star;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all within were paths and alleys wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>With footing worn, and leading inward far;</div>
      <div class='line'>Far harbour that them seems: so in they enter’d are.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And forth they pass, with pleasure forward led,</div>
      <div class='line'>Joying to hear the birds’ sweet harmony,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which therein shrowded from the tempest’s dread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem’d in their song to scorn the cruel sky.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>Much can they praise the trees so straight and high,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sailing pine, the cedar proud and tall,</div>
      <div class='line'>The vine-prop elm, the poplar never dry,</div>
      <div class='line'>The builder oak, sole king of forests all,</div>
      <div class='line'>The aspen good for staves, the cypress funeral.’<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c009'><sup>[64]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Artificial flowers look pretty in a lady’s head-dress; but they will
not do to stick into lofty verse. On the contrary, a crocus bursting
out of the ground seems to blush with its own golden light—‘a
thing of life.’ So a greater authority than Lord Byron has given
his testimony on this subject: ‘Behold the lilies of the field, they
toil not, neither do they spin; yet I say unto you, that even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.’ Shakspeare
speaks of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Daffodils,</div>
      <div class='line'>That come before the swallow dares and take</div>
      <div class='line'>The winds of March with beauty.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>All this play of fancy and dramatic interest could not be transferred
to a description of hot-house plants, regulated by a thermometer.
Lord Byron unfairly enlists into the service of his argument those
artificial objects, which are direct imitations of nature, such as
statuary, etc. This is an oversight. At this rate, all poetry would
be artificial poetry. Dr. Darwin is among those, who have endeavoured
to confound the distinctions of natural and artificial poetry, and indeed,
he is, perhaps, the only one who has gone the whole length of Lord
Byron’s hypercritical and super-artificial theory. Here are some of
his lines, which have been greatly admired.</p>

<p class='c016'>This is the true false gallop of the sublime. Yet steel is a very
useful metal, and doubtless performs all these wonders. But it has
not, among so many others, the virtue of amalgamating with the
imagination. We might quote also his description of the spinning-jenny,
which is pronounced by Dr. Aikin to be as ingenious a piece of
mechanism as the object it describes; and, according to Lord Byron,
this last is as well suited to the manufacture of verses as of cotton-twist
without end.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Natural interests are those which are real and inevitable, and
are so far contradistinguished from the artificial, which are factitious
and affected. If Lord Byron cannot understand the difference, he
may find it explained by contrasting some of Chaucer’s characters
and incidents with those in the Rape of the Lock, for instance.
Custance floating in her boat on the wide sea, is different from Pope’s
heroine,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Griselda’s loss of her children, one by one, of her <em>all</em>, does not
belong to the same class of incidents, nor of subjects for poetry, as
Belinda’s loss of her favourite curl. A sentiment that has rooted
itself in the heart, and can only be torn from it with life, is not like
the caprice of the moment—the putting on of paint and patches, or
the pulling off a glove. The inbred character is not like a masquerade
dress. There is a difference between the theatrical, and natural,
which is important to the determination of the present question, and
which has been overlooked by his Lordship. Mr. Bowles, however,
formally insists (and with the best right in the world) on the
distinction between passion and manners. But he agrees with Lord
Byron, that the Epistle to Abelard is the height of the pathetic.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Strange that such difference should be</div>
      <div class='line'>Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That it is in a great degree pathetic, we should be amongst the last
to dispute; but its character is more properly rhetorical and voluptuous.
That its interest is of the highest or deepest order, is what we should
wonder to hear any one affirm, who is intimate with Shakspeare,
Chaucer, Boccacio, our own early dramatists, or the Greek tragedians.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>There is more true, unfeigned, unspeakable, heart-felt distress in one
line of Chaucer’s tale just mentioned,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let me not like a worm go by the way,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>than in all Pope’s writings put together; and we say it without
any disrespect to him too. Didactic poetry has to do with manners,
as they are regulated, not by fashion or caprice, but by abstract
reason and grave opinion, and is equally remote from the dramatic,
which describes the involuntary and unpremeditated impulses of
nature. As Lord Byron refers to the Bible, we would just ask
him here, which he thinks the most poetical parts of it, the Law of
the Twelve Tables, the Book of Leviticus, etc.; or the Book of Job,
Jacob’s dream, the story of Ruth etc?</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Supernatural poetry is, in the sense here insisted on, allied to
nature, not to art, because it relates to the impressions made upon the
mind by unknown objects and powers, out of the reach both of the
cognizance and will of man, and still more able to startle and
confound his imagination, while he supposes them to exist, than
either those of nature or art. The Witches in Macbeth, the Furies
in Æschylus, are so far artificial objects, that they are creatures of the
poet’s brain; but their impression on the mind depends on their
possessing attributes, which baffle and set at nought all human pretence,
and laugh at all human efforts to tamper with them. Satan
in Milton is an artificial or ideal character: but would any one call
this artificial poetry? It is, in Lord Byron’s phrase, super-artificial,
as well as super-human poetry. But it is serious business. Fate, if not
Nature, is its ruling genius. The Pandemonium is not a baby-house
of the fancy, and it is ranked (ordinarily,) with natural, <em>i.e.</em> with the
highest and most important order of poetry, and above the Rape of
the Lock. We intended a definition, and have run again into
examples. Lord Byron’s <em>concretions</em> have spoiled us for philosophy.
We will therefore leave off here, and conclude with a character of
Pope, which seems to have been written with an eye to this question,
and which (for what we know) is as near a solution of it as the
Noble Letter-writer’s emphatical division of Pope’s writings into
ethical, mock-heroic, and fanciful poetry.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Pope was not assuredly a poet of this class, or in the first rank of
it. He saw nature only dressed by art; he judged of beauty by
fashion; he sought for truth in the opinions of the world; he judged
of the feelings of others by his own. The capacious soul of Shakspeare
had an intuitive and mighty sympathy with whatever could
enter into the heart of man in all possible circumstances: Pope had
an exact knowledge of all that he himself loved or hated, wished or
wanted. Milton has winged his daring flight from heaven to earth,
through Chaos and old Night. Pope’s Muse never wandered with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>safety, but from his library to his grotto, or from his grotto into his
library back again. His mind dwelt with greater pleasure on his
own garden, than on the garden of Eden; he could describe the
faultless whole-length mirror that reflected his own person, better than
the smooth surface of the lake that reflects the face of heaven—a
piece of cut glass or a pair of paste buckles with more brilliance and
effect, than a thousand dew-drops glittering in the sun. He would
be more delighted with a patent lamp, than with “the pale reflex of
Cynthia’s brow,” that fills the skies with its soft silent lustre, that
trembles through the cottage window, and cheers the watchful
mariner on the lonely wave. In short, he was the poet of personality
and of polished life. That which was nearest to him, was the
greatest; the fashion of the day bore sway in his mind over the
immutable laws of nature. He preferred the artificial to the natural
in external objects, because he had a stronger fellow-feeling with
the self-love of the maker or proprietor of a gewgaw, than admiration
of that which was interesting to all mankind. He preferred the
artificial to the natural in passion, because the involuntary and uncalculating
impulses of the one hurried him away with a force and
vehemence with which he could not grapple; while he could trifle
with the conventional and superficial modifications of mere sentiment
at will, laugh at or admire, put them on or off like a masquerade dress,
make much or little of them, indulge them for a longer or a shorter
time, as he pleased; and because while they amused his fancy and
exercised his ingenuity, they never once disturbed his vanity, his levity,
or indifference. His mind was the antithesis of strength and grandeur;
its power was the power of indifference. He had none of the enthusiasm
of poetry; he was in poetry what the sceptic is in religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘It cannot be denied, that his chief excellence lay more in
diminishing, than in aggrandizing objects; in checking, not in encouraging
our enthusiasm; in sneering at the extravagances of fancy
or passion, instead of giving a loose to them; in describing a row of
pins and needles, rather than the embattled spears of Greeks and
Trojans; in penning a lampoon or a compliment, and in praising
Martha Blount.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Shakspeare says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“——In Fortune’s ray and brightness</div>
      <div class='line'>The herd hath more annoyance by the brize</div>

      <div class='line'>The thing of courage,</div>
      <div class='line'>As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathise;</div>

      <div class='line'>Replies to chiding Fortune.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>There is none of this rough work in Pope. His Muse was on a
peace-establishment, and grew somewhat effeminate by long ease and
indulgence. He lived in the smiles of fortune, and basked in the
favour of the great. In his smooth and polished verse we meet with
no prodigies of nature, but with miracles of wit; the thunders of his
pen are whispered flatteries; its forked lightnings pointed sarcasms;
for—“the gnarled oak,” he gives us “the soft myrtle:” for rocks, and
seas, and mountains, artificial grass-plats, gravel-walks, and tinkling
rills; for earthquakes and tempests, the breaking of a flower-pot, or
the fall of a china jar; for the tug and war of the elements, or the
deadly strife of the passions, we have</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Calm contemplation and poetic ease.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Yet within this retired and narrow circle how much, and that how
exquisite, was contained! What discrimination, what wit, what
delicacy, what fancy, what lurking spleen, what elegance of thought,
what pampered refinement of sentiment! It is like looking at the
world through a microscope, where every thing assumes a new
character and a new consequence, where things are seen in their
minutest circumstances and slightest shades of difference; where the
little becomes gigantic, the deformed beautiful, and the beautiful
deformed. The wrong end of the magnifier is, to be sure, held to
everything, but still the exhibition is highly curious, and we know
not whether to be most pleased or surprised. Such, at least, is the
best account I am able to give of this extraordinary man, without
doing injustice to him or others.’</p>

<p class='c016'>Many people boast of being masters in their own house. I pretend
to be master of my own mind. I should be sorry to have an ejectment
served upon me for any notions I may chuse to entertain there.
Within that little circle I would fain be an absolute monarch. I do
not profess the spirit of martyrdom; I have no ambition to march to
the stake or up to a masked battery, in defence of an hypothesis: I
do not court the rack: I do not wish to be flayed alive for affirming
that two and two make four, or any other intricate proposition: I
am shy of bodily pains and penalties, which some are fond of, imprisonment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>fine, banishment, confiscation of goods: but if I do not
prefer the independence of my mind to that of my body, I at least
prefer it to every thing else. I would avoid the arm of power, as I
would escape from the fangs of a wild beast: but as to the opinion of
the world, I see nothing formidable in it. ‘It is the eye of childhood
that fears a painted devil.’ I am not to be brow-beat or wheedled
out of any of my settled convictions. Opinion to opinion, I will face
any man. Prejudice, fashion, the cant of the moment, go for nothing;
and as for the reason of the thing, it can only be supposed to rest
with me or another, in proportion to the pains we have taken to
ascertain it. Where the pursuit of truth has been the habitual study
of any man’s life, the love of truth will be his ruling passion. ‘Where
the treasure is, there the heart is also.’ Every one is most tenacious
of that to which he owes his distinction from others. Kings love
power, misers gold, women flattery, poets reputation—and philosophers
truth, when they can find it. They are right in cherishing the only
privilege they inherit. If ‘to be wise were to be obstinate,’ I might
set up for as great a philosopher as the best of them; for some of
my conclusions are as fixed and as incorrigible to proof as need be.
I am attached to them in consequence of the pains, the anxiety, and
the waste of time they have cost me. In fact, I should not well
know what to do without them at this time of day; nor how to get
others to supply their place. I would quarrel with the best friend I
have sooner than acknowledge the absolute right of the Bourbons.
I see Mr. —— seldomer than I did, because I cannot agree with
him about the <cite>Catalogue Raisonnée</cite>. I remember once saying to this
gentleman, a great while ago, that I did not seem to have altered
any of my ideas since I was sixteen years old. ‘Why then,’ said
he,’ you are no wiser now than you were then!’ I might make the
same confession, and the same retort would apply still. Coleridge
used to tell me, that this pertinacity was owing to a want of sympathy
with others. What he calls <em>sympathising with others</em> is their admiring
him, and it must be admitted that he varies his battery pretty often,
in order to accommodate himself to this sort of mutual understanding.
But I do not agree in what he says of me. On the other hand, I
think that it is my sympathising <em>beforehand</em> with the different views
and feelings that may be entertained on a subject, that prevents my
retracting my judgment, and flinging myself into the contrary extreme
<em>afterwards</em>. If you proscribe all opinion opposite to your own, and
impertinently exclude all the evidence that does not make for you, it
stares you in the face with double force when it breaks in unexpectedly
upon you, or if at any subsequent period it happens to suit
your interest or convenience to listen to objections which vanity or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>prudence had hitherto overlooked. But if you are aware from the
first suggestion of a subject, either by subtlety of tact, or close attention,
of the full force of what others possibly feel and think of it, you
are not exposed to the same vacillation of opinion. The number of
grains and scruples, of doubts and difficulties, thrown into the scale
while the balance is yet undecided, add to the weight and steadiness
of the determination. He who anticipates his opponent’s arguments,
confirms while he corrects his own reasonings. When a question
has been carefully examined in all its bearings, and a principle is once
established, it is not liable to be overthrown by any new facts which
have been arbitrarily and petulantly set aside, nor by every wind of
idle doctrine rushing into the interstices of a hollow speculation,
shattering it in pieces, and leaving it a mockery and a bye-word; like
those tall, gawky, staring, pyramidal erections which are seen scattered
over different parts of the country, and are called the <em>Follies</em> of
different gentlemen! A man may be confident in maintaining a side,
as he has been cautious in chusing it. If after making up his mind
strongly in one way, to the best of his capacity and judgment, he
feels himself inclined to a very violent revulsion of sentiment, he may
generally rest assured that the change is in himself and his motives,
not in the reason of things.</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot say that, from my own experience, I have found that the
persons most remarkable for sudden and violent changes of principle
have been cast in the softest or most susceptible mould. All their
notions have been exclusive, bigoted, and intolerant. Their want of
consistency and moderation has been in exact proportion to their
want of candour and comprehensiveness of mind. Instead of being
the creatures of sympathy, open to conviction, unwilling to give
offence by the smallest difference of sentiment, they have (for the
most part) been made up of mere antipathies—a very repulsive sort
of personages—at odds with themselves, and with every body else.
The slenderness of their pretensions to philosophical inquiry has been
accompanied with the most presumptuous dogmatism. They have
been persons of that narrowness of view and headstrong self-sufficiency
of purpose, that they could see only one side of a question at a time,
and whichever they pleased. There is a story somewhere in Don
Quixote, of two champions coming to a shield hung up against a tree
with an inscription written on each side of it. Each of them maintained,
that the words were what was written on the side next him,
and never dreamt, till the fray was over, that they might be different
on the opposite side of the shield. It would have been a little more
extraordinary if the combatants had changed sides in the heat of the
scuffle, and stoutly denied that there were any such words on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>opposite side as they had before been bent on sacrificing their lives
to prove were the only ones it contained. Yet such is the very
situation of some of our modern polemics. They have been of all
sides of the question, and yet they cannot conceive how an honest
man can be of any but one—that which they hold at present. It
seems that they are afraid to look their old opinions in the face, lest
they should be fascinated by them once more. They banish all
doubts of their own sincerity by inveighing against the motives of
their antagonists. There is no salvation out of the pale of their
strange inconsistency. They reduce common sense and probity to
the straitest possible limits—the breasts of themselves and their
patrons. They are like people out at sea on a very narrow plank,
who try to push every body else off. Is it that they have so little
faith in the cause to which they have become such staunch converts,
as to suppose that, should they allow a grain of sense to their old
allies and new antagonists, they will have more than they? Is it
that they have so little consciousness of their own disinterestedness,
that they feel if they allow a particle of honesty to those who now
differ with them, they will have more than they? Those opinions
must needs be of a very fragile texture which will not stand the
shock of the least acknowledged opposition, and which lay claim to
respectability by stigmatising all who do not hold them as ‘sots, and
knaves, and cowards.’ There is a want of well-balanced feeling in
every such instance of extravagant versatility; a something crude,
unripe, and harsh, that does not hit a judicious palate, but sets the
teeth on edge to think of. ‘I had rather hear my mother’s cat mew,
or a wheel grate on the axle-tree, than one of these same metre-balladmongers’
chaunt his incondite retrograde lays without rhyme and
without reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principles and professions change: the man remains the same.
There is the same spirit at the bottom of all this pragmatical fickleness
and virulence, whether it runs into one extreme or another:—to
wit, a confinement of view, a jealousy of others, an impatience of
contradiction, a want of liberality in construing the motives of others
either from monkish pedantry, or a conceited overweening reference
of every thing to our own fancies and feelings. There is something
to be said, indeed, for the nature of the political machinery, for the
whirling motion of the revolutionary wheel which has of late wrenched
men’s understandings almost asunder, and ‘amazed the very faculties
of eyes and ears;’ but still this is hardly a sufficient reason, why the
adept in the old as well as the new school should take such a prodigious
latitude himself, while at the same time he makes so little
allowance for others. His whole creed need not be turned topsy-turvy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>from the top to the bottom, even in times like these. He
need not, in the rage of party spirit, discard the proper attributes of
humanity, the common dictates of reason. He need not outrage
every former feeling, nor trample on every customary decency, in his
zeal for reform, or in his greater zeal against it. If his mind, like his
body, has undergone a total change of essence, and purged off the
taint of all its early opinions, he need not carry about with him, or be
haunted in the persons of others with, the phantoms of his altered
principles to loathe and execrate them. He need not (as it were)
pass an act of attainder on all his thoughts, hopes, wishes, from
youth upwards, to offer them at the shrine of matured servility: he
need not become one vile antithesis, a living and ignominious satire on
himself. Mr. Wordsworth has hardly, I should think, so much as
a single particle of feeling left in his whole composition, the same
that he had twenty years ago; not ‘so small a drop of pity,’ for what
he then was, ‘as a wren’s eye,’—except that I do not hear that he
has given up his theory that poetry should be written in the language
of prose, or applied for an injunction against the Lyrical Ballads. I
will wager a trifle, that our ingenious poet will not concede to any
patron, (how noble and munificent soever) that the Leech Gatherer
is not a fit subject of the Muse, and would sooner resign the stamp-distributorship
of two counties, than burn that portion of the Recluse,
a Poem, which has been given to the world under the title of the
Excursion. The tone, however, of Mr. Wordsworth’s poetical
effusions requires a little revision to adapt it to the progressive improvement
in his political sentiments: for, as far as I understand the
Poems themselves or the Preface, his whole system turns upon this,
that the thoughts, the feelings, the expressions of the common people
in country places are the most refined of all others; at once the most
pure, the most simple, and the most sublime:—yet, with one stroke
of his prose-pen, he disfranchises the whole rustic population of Westmoreland
and Cumberland from voting at elections, and says there is
not a man among them that is not a knave in grain. In return, he
lets them still retain the privilege of expressing their sentiments in
select and natural language in the Lyrical Ballads. So much for
poetical justice and political severity! An author’s political theories
sit loose upon him, and may be changed like his clothes. His literary
vanity, alas! sticks to him like his skin, and survives in its first gloss
and sleekness, amidst</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Southey still makes experiments on metre, not on governments,
and seems to think the last resort of English liberty is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>court-iambics. Still the same upstart self-sufficiency, still the same
itch of new fangled innovation directed into a new channel, still the
same principle of favouritism, still the same overcharged and splenetic
hostility—all is right that he approves, all is wrong that opposes his
views in the smallest particular. There is no inconsistency in all
these anomalies. Absurdity is uniform; egotism is the same thing;
a limited range of comprehension is a habit of mind that a man seldom
gets the better of, and may distinguish equally the Pantisocratist or
Constitutional Association-monger.</p>

<p class='c007'>To quit this, which is rather a stale topic, as well as a hopeless
one, and give some instances of a change of sentiment in individuals,
which may serve for materials of a history of opinion in the beginning
of the 19th century:—A gentleman went to live, some years ago,
in a remote part of the country, and as he did not wish to affect
singularity he used to have two candles on his table of an evening.
A romantic acquaintance of his in the neighbourhood, smit with the
love of simplicity and equality, used to come in, and without ceremony
snuff one of them out, saying, it was a shame to indulge in such
extravagance, while many a poor cottager had not even a rush-light
to see to do their evening’s work by. This might be about the year
1802, and was passed over as among the ordinary occurrences of the
day. In 1816 (oh! fearful lapse of time, pregnant with strange
mutability), the same enthusiastic lover of economy, and hater of
luxury, asked his thoughtless friend to dine with him in company with
a certain lord, and to lend him his man servant to wait at table; and
just before they were sitting down to dinner, he heard him say to the
servant in a sonorous whisper—‘and be sure you don’t forget to have
six candles on the table!’ Extremes meet. The event here was
as true to itself as the oscillation of the pendulum. My informant,
who understands moral equations, had looked for this reaction,
and noted it down as characteristic. The impertinence in the first
instance was the cue to the ostentatious servility in the second. The
one was the fulfilment of the other, like the type and anti-type of a
prophecy. No—the keeping of the character at the end of fourteen
years was as unique as the keeping of the thought to the end of the
fourteen lines of a Sonnet! Would it sound strange if I were to
whisper it in the reader’s ear, that it was the same person who was
thus anxious to see six candles on the table to receive a lord, who
once (in ages past) said to me, that ‘he saw nothing to admire in the
eloquence of such men as Mansfield and Chatham; and what did it
all end in, but their being made Lords?’ It is better to be a lord
than a lacquey to a lord. So we see that the swelling pride and preposterous
self-opinion which exalts itself above the mightiest, looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>down upon, and braying the boasted pretensions of the highest rank
and the most brilliant talents as nothing, compared with its own conscious
powers and silent unmoved self-respect, grovels and licks the
dust before titled wealth, like a lacquered slave, the moment it can
get wages and a livery! Would Milton or Marvel have done thus?</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Coleridge, indeed, sets down this outrageous want of keeping
to an excess of sympathy, and there is, after all, some truth in his
suggestion. There is a craving after the approbation and concurrence
of others natural to the mind of man. It is difficult to sustain the
weight of an opinion singly for any length of way. The intellect
languishes without cordial encouragement and support. It exhausts
both strength and patience to be always striving against the stream.
<i><span lang="la">Contra audentior ito</span></i>—is the motto but of few. Public opinion is
always pressing upon the mind, and, like the air we breathe, acts
unseen, unfelt. It supplies the living current of our thoughts, and
infects without our knowledge. It taints the blood, and is taken into
the smallest pores. The most sanguine constitutions are, perhaps,
the most exposed to its influence. But public opinion has its source
in power, in popular prejudice, and is not always in accord with right
reason, or a high and abstracted imagination. Which path to follow
where the two roads part? The heroic and romantic resolution prevails
at first in high and heroic tempers. They think to scale the
heights of truth and virtue at once with him ‘whose genius had
angelic wings, and fed on manna,’—but after a time find themselves
baffled, toiling on in an uphill road, without friends, in a cold neighbourhood,
without aid or prospect of success. The poet</p>

<p class='c016'>He hears murmurs loud or suppressed, meets blank looks or scowling
faces, is exposed to the pelting of the pitiless press, and is stunned by
the shout of the mob, that gather round him to see what sort of a
creature a poet and a philosopher is. What is there to make him
proof against all this? A strength of understanding steeled against
temptation, and a dear love of truth that smiles opinion to scorn?
These he perhaps has not. A lord passes in his coach. Might he
not get up, and ride out of the reach of the rabble-rout? He is
invited to stop dinner. If he stays he may insinuate some wholesome
truths. He drinks in rank poison—flattery! He recites some
verses to the ladies, who smile delicious praise, and thank him through
their tears. The master of the house suggests a happy allusion in
the turn of an expression. ‘There’s sympathy.’ This is better
than the company he lately left. Pictures, statues meet his raptured
eye. Our Ulysses finds himself in the gardens of Alcinous: our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>truant is fairly caught. He wanders through enchanted ground.
Groves, classic groves, nod unto him, and he hears ‘ancestral voices’
hailing him as brother-bard! He sleeps, dreams, and wakes cured
of his thriftless prejudices and morose philanthropy. He likes this
courtly and popular sympathy better. ‘He looks up with awe to
kings; with honour to nobility; with reverence to magistrates,’ &#38;c.
He no longer breathes the air of heaven and his own thoughts, but
is steeped in that of palaces and courts, and finds it agree better with
his constitutional temperament. Oh! how sympathy alters a man
from what he was!</p>

<p class='c007'>A spirit of contradiction, a wish to monopolise all wisdom, will
not account for uniform consistency, for it is sure to defeat and turn
against itself. It is ‘every thing by turns, and nothing long.’ It is
warped and crooked. It cannot bear the least opposition, and sooner
than acquiesce in what others approve it will change sides in a day.
It is offended at every resistance to its captious, domineering humour,
and will quarrel for straws with its best friends. A person under the
guidance of this demon, if every whimsy or occult discovery of his
own is not received with acclamation by one party, will wreak his
spite by deserting to the other, and carry all his talent for disputation
with him, sharpened by rage and disappointment. A man, to be
steady in a cause, should be more attached to the truth than to the
acquiescence of his fellow-citizens. A young student, who came up
to town a few years since with some hypercritical refinements on the
modern philosophy to introduce him to the Gamaliels of the age, but
who would allow no one else to have a right view of the common
doctrines of the school, or to be able to assign a reason for the faith
that was in him, was sent to Coventry by the true adepts, who were
many of them as wise and as fastidious as himself. He therefore
turned round upon the whole set for this indignity, and has been
playing off the heavy artillery of his scurrilous abuse, his verbal logic,
and the powerful distinctions of the civil and canon law upon the
devoted heads of his tasteless associates; ‘perpetual volley, arrowy
sleet,’ ever since! It is needless to mention names. The learned
gentleman having left his ungrateful party and unprofitable principles
in dudgeon, has gone into the opposite extreme like mad, sticks at
nothing, is callous to public opinion, so that he pleases his employers,
and can become ‘a thorn in the side of freedom’; and fairly takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>the bridle in his teeth, stop him who can. A more obstinate being
never took pen in hand. Yet, by agreeing to his conclusions, and subscribing
to his arguments (such as they are) it would be still possible
to make him give up every one of his absurdities in succession, and
to drive him to set up another New Daily Paper against himself!</p>

<p class='c007'>I can hardly consider Mr. Coleridge as a deserter from the cause
he first espoused, unless one could tell what cause he ever heartily
espoused, or what party he ever belonged to, in downright earnest.
He has not been inconsistent with himself at different times, but at
all times. He is a sophist, a casuist, a rhetorician, what you please;
and might have argued or declaimed to the end of his breath on one
side of a question or another, but he never was a pragmatical fellow.
He lived in a round of contradictions, and never came to a settled
point. His fancy gave the cue to his judgment, and his vanity set
his invention afloat in whatever direction he could find most scope for
it, or most <em>sympathy</em>, that is, admiration. His Life and Opinions
might naturally receive the title of one of Hume’s Essays—‘A
Sceptical Solution of Sceptical Doubts.’ To be sure, his <span class='sc'>Watchman</span>
and his <span class='sc'>Friend</span> breathe a somewhat different tone on subjects of a
particular description, both of them apparently pretty high-raised, but
whoever will be at the pains to examine them closely, will find them
to be <em>voluntaries</em>, fugues, solemn capriccios, not set compositions with
any malice prepense in them, or much practical meaning. I believe
some of his friends, who were indebted to him for the suggestion of
plausible reasons for conformity, and an opening to a more qualified
view of the letter of their paradoxical principles, have lately disgusted
him by the virulence and extravagance to which they have carried
hints, of which he never suspected that they would make the least
possible use. But if Mr. Coleridge is satisfied with the wandering
Moods of his Mind, perhaps this is no reason that others may not
reap the solid benefit. He himself is like the idle sea-weed on the
ocean, tossed from shore to shore: they are like barnacles fastened
to the vessel of state, rotting its goodly timbers!</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some persons who are of too fastidious a turn of mind
to like any thing long, or to assent twice to the same opinion. ——
always sets himself to prop the falling cause, to nurse the ricketty
bantling. He takes the part which he thinks in most need of his
support, not so much out of magnanimity, as to prevent too great a
degree of presumption or self-complacency on the triumphant side.
‘Though truth be truth, yet he contrives to throw such changes of
vexation on it as it may lose some colour.’ I have been delighted to
hear him expatiate with the most natural and affecting simplicity on a
favourite passage or picture, and all the while afraid of agreeing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>him, lest he should instantly turn round and unsay all that he had
said, for fear of my going away with too good an opinion of my own
taste, or too great an admiration of my idol—and his own. I dare
not ask his opinion twice, if I have got a favourable sentence once,
lest he should belie his own sentiments to stagger mine. I have
heard him talk divinely (like one inspired) of Boccaccio, and the
story of the Pot of Basil, describing ‘how it grew, and it grew, and
it grew,’ till you saw it spread its tender leaves in the light of his
eye, and wave in the tremulous sound of his voice; and yet if you
asked him about it at another time, he would, perhaps, affect to think
little of it, or to have forgotten the circumstance. His enthusiasm is
fickle and treacherous. The instant he finds it shared in common,
he backs out of it. His enmity is equally refined, but hardly so
unsocial. His exquisitely turned invectives display all the beauty of
scorn, and impart elegance to vulgarity. He sometimes finds out
minute excellencies, and cries up one thing to put you out of conceit
with another. If you want him to praise Sir Joshua <i><span lang="la">con amore</span></i>,
in his best manner, you should begin with saying something about
Titian—if you seem an idoliser of Sir Joshua, he will immediately
turn off the discourse, gliding like the serpent before Eve, wary and
beautiful, to the graces of Sir Peter Lely, or ask if you saw a
Vandyke the other day, which he does not think Sir Joshua could
stand near. But find fault with the Lake Poets, and mention some
pretended patron of rising genius, and you need not fear but he will
join in with you and go all lengths that you can wish him. You may
calculate upon him there. ‘Pride elevates, and joy brightens his
face.’ And, indeed, so eloquent is he, and so beautiful in his
eloquence, that I myself, with all my freedom from gall and bitterness,
could listen to him untired, and without knowing how the time went,
losing and neglecting many a meal and hour,</p>

<p class='c007'>When I cease to hear him quite, other tongues, turned to what
accents they may of praise or blame, will sound dull, ungrateful, out

<p class='c007'>An overstrained enthusiasm produces a capriciousness in taste, as
well as too much indifference. A person who sets no bounds to his
admiration takes a surfeit of his favourites. He over-does the thing.
He gets sick of his own everlasting praises, and affected raptures.
His preferences are a great deal too violent to last. He wears out
an author in a week, that might last him a year, or his life, by the
eagerness with which he devours him. Every such favourite is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>his turn the greatest writer in the world. Compared with the lord
of the ascendant for the time being, Shakspeare is common-place,
and Milton a pedant, a little insipid or so. Some of these prodigies
require to be dragged out of their lurking-places, and cried up to the
top of the compass;—their traits are subtle, and must be violently
obtruded on the sight. But the effort of exaggerated praise, though
it may stagger others, tires the maker, and we hear of them no more
after a while. Others take their turns, are swallowed whole,
undigested, ravenously, and disappear in the same manner. Good
authors share the fate of bad, and a library in a few years is nearly
dismantled. It is a pity thus to outlive our admiration, and exhaust
our relish of what is excellent. Actors and actresses are disposed
of in the same conclusive peremptory way: some of them are
talked of for months, nay, years; then it is almost an offence to
mention them. Friends, acquaintance, go the same road;—are now
asked to come six days in the week, then warned against coming the
seventh. The smallest faults are soon magnified in those we think
too highly of: but where shall we find perfection? If we will put up
with nothing short of that, we shall have neither pictures, books, nor
friends left—we shall have nothing but our own absurdities to keep
company with! ‘In all things a regular and moderate indulgence is
the best security for a lasting enjoyment.’ <span class='sc'>Burke.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>There are numbers who judge by the event, and change with
fortune. They extol the hero of the day, and join the prevailing
clamour whatever it is; so that the fluctuating state of public opinion
regulates their feverish, restless enthusiasm, like a thermometer.
They blow hot or cold, according as the wind sets favourably or
otherwise. With such people the only infallible test of merit is
success; and no arguments are true that have not a large or powerful
majority on their side. They go by appearances. Their vanity,
not the truth, is their ruling object. They are not the last to quit a
falling cause, and they are the first to hail the rising sun. Their
minds want sincerity, modesty, and keeping. With them—</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>Such servile flatterers made an idol of Buonaparte while fortune
smiled upon him, but when it left him, they removed him from his
pedestal in the cabinet of their vanity, as we take down the picture of
a relation that has died without naming us in his will. The opinion
of such triflers is worth nothing: it is merely an echo. We do not
want to be told the event of a question, but the rights of it. Truth
is in their theory nothing but ‘noise and inexplicable dumb show.’
They are the heralds, outriders, and trumpeters in the procession of
fame; are more loud and boisterous than the rest, and give themselves
great airs, as the avowed patrons and admirers of genius and merit.</p>

<p class='c007'>As there are many who change their sentiments with circumstances,
(as they decided lawsuits in Rabelais with the dice), so there are
others who change them with their acquaintance. ‘Tell me your
company, and I’ll tell you your opinions,’ might be said to many
a man who piques himself on a select and superior view of things,
distinct from the vulgar. Individuals of this class are quick and
versatile, but they are not beforehand with opinion. They catch it,
when it is pointed out to them, and take it at the rebound, instead of
giving the first impulse. Their minds are a light, luxuriant soil, into
which thoughts are easily transplanted, and shoot up with uncommon
sprightliness and vigour. They wear the dress of other people’s
minds very gracefully and unconsciously. They tell you your own
opinion, or very gravely repeat an observation you have made to them
about half a year afterwards. They let you into the delicacies and
luxuries of Spenser with great disinterestedness, in return for your
having introduced that author to their notice. They prefer West to
Raphael, Stothard to Rubens, till they are told better. Still they
are acute in the main, and good judges in their way. By trying to
improve their taste, and reform their notions according to an ideal
standard, they perhaps spoil and muddle their native faculties, rather
than do them any good. Their first manner is their best, because it
is the most natural. It is well not to go out of ourselves, and to be
contented to take up with what we are, for better for worse. We
can neither beg, borrow, nor steal characteristic excellencies. Some
views and modes of thinking suit certain minds, as certain colours suit
certain complexions. We may part with very shining and very useful
qualities without getting better ones to supply them. Mocking is
catching, only in regard to defects. Mimicry is always dangerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary to change our road in order to advance on our
journey. We should cultivate the spot of ground we possess to the
utmost of our power, though it may be circumscribed and comparatively
barren. <em>A rolling stone gathers no moss.</em> People may
collect all the wisdom they will ever attain, quite as well by staying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>at home as by travelling abroad. There is no use in shifting from
place to place, from side to side, or from subject to subject. You
have always to begin again, and never finish any course of study or
observation. By adhering to the same principles you do not become
stationary. You enlarge, correct, and consolidate your reasonings,
without contradicting and shuffling about in your conclusions. If
truth consisted in hasty assumptions and petulant contradictions, there
might be some ground for this whiffling and violent inconsistency.
But the face of truth, like that of nature, is different and the same.
The first outline of an opinion, and the general tone of thinking, may
be sound and correct, though we may spend any quantity of time and
pains in working up and uniting the parts at subsequent sittings. If
we have mistaken the character of the countenance altogether at first,
no alterations will bring it right afterwards. Those who mistake
white for black in the first instance, may as well mistake black for
white when they reverse their canvass. I do not see what security
they can have in their present opinions, who build their pretension to
wisdom on the total folly, rashness, and extravagance (to say no
worse) of their former ones. The perspective may change with
years and experience: we may see certain things nearer, and others
more remote; but the great masses and landmarks will remain,
though thrown into shadow and tinged by the intervening atmosphere:
so the laws of the understanding, the truth of nature, will remain, and
cannot be thrown into utter confusion and perplexity by our blunders
or caprice, like the objects in Hogarth’s Rules of Perspective, where
every thing is turned upside down, or thrust out of its well-known
place. I cannot understand how our political Harlequins feel after
all their summersaults and metamorphoses. They can hardly, I
should think, look at themselves in the glass, or walk across the room
without stumbling. This at least would be the case if they had the
least reflection or self-knowledge. But they judge from pique and
vanity solely. There should be a certain decorum in life as in a
picture, without which it is neither useful nor agreeable. If my
opinions are not right, at any rate they are the best I have been able
to form, and better than any others I could take up at random, or out
of perversity, now. Certainly opinions vitiate one another, and
destroy the simplicity and clearness of the mind: nothing is good
that has not a beginning, a middle, and an end; and I would wish
my thoughts to be</p>

<p class='c007'>I have in my time known few thorough partisans; at least on my own
side of the question. I conceive, however, that the honestest and
strongest-minded men have been so. In general, interest, fear, vanity,
the love of contradiction, even a scrupulous regard to truth and justice,
come to divert them from the popular cause. It is a character that
requires very opposite and almost incompatible qualities—reason and
prejudice, a passionate attachment founded on an abstract idea. He
who can take up a speculative question, and pursue it with the same
zeal and unshaken constancy that he does his immediate interests or
private animosities, he who is as faithful to his principles as he is to
himself, is the true partisan. I do not here speak of the bigot, or the
mercenary or cowardly tool of a party. There are plenty of this
description of persons (a considerable majority of the inhabitants of
every country)—who are ‘ever strong upon the stronger side,’
staunch, thorough-paced sticklers for their passions and prejudices,
and who stand by their party as long as their party can stand by them.
I speak of those who espouse a cause from liberal motives and with
liberal views, and of the obstacles that are so often found to relax
their perseverance or impair their zeal. These may, I think, be
reduced chiefly to the heads of obligations to friends, of vanity, or the
desire of the lead and distinction, to an over-squeamish delicacy in
regard to appearances, to fickleness of purpose, or to natural timidity
and weakness of nerve.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing more contemptible than party spirit in one point
of view; and yet it seems inseparable in practice from public principle.
You cannot support measures unless you support men;—you cannot
carry any point or maintain any system, without acting in concert with
others. In theory, it is all very well. We may refine in our distinctions,
and elevate our language to what point we please. But in
carrying the most sounding words and stateliest propositions into
effect, we must make use of the instrumentality of men; and some of
the alloy and imperfection of the means may insinuate itself into the
end. If we do not go all lengths with those who are embarked with
us in the same views; if we are not hearty in the defence of their
interests and motives; if we are not fully in their confidence and they
in ours; if we do not ingraft on the stock of public virtue the charities
and sentiments of private affection and esteem; if the bustle and
anxiety and irritation of the state-affairs do not kindle into the glow
of friendship as well as patriotism; if we look distant, suspicious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>lukewarm at one another; if we criticise, carp at, pry into the conduct
of our party with watchful, jealous eyes; it is to be feared we shall
play the game into the enemy’s hands, and not co-operate together for
the common good with all the steadiness and cordiality that might be
wished. On the other hand, if we lend ourselves to the foibles and
weaknesses of our friends; if we suffer ourselves to be implicated in
their intrigues, their scrambles and bargainings for place and power;
if we flatter their mistakes, and not only screen them from the eyes of
others, but are blind to them ourselves; if we compromise a great
principle in the softness of a womanish friendship; if we entangle
ourselves in needless family-ties; if we sell ourselves to the vices of a
patron, or become the mouthpiece and echo of a <i><span lang="fr">coterie</span></i>; we shall
be in that case slaves of a faction, not servants of the public, nor
shall we long have a spark of the old Roman or the old English
virtue left. Good-nature, conviviality, hospitality, habits of acquaintance
and regard, favours received or conferred, spirit and
eloquence to defend a friend when pressed hard upon, courtesy and
good-breeding, are one thing—patriotism, firmness of principle, are
another. The true patriot knows when to make each of these in
turn give way to or control the other, in furtherance of the common
good, just as the accomplished courtier makes all other interests,
friendships, cabals, resentments, reconciliations, subservient to his
attachment to the person of the king. He has the welfare of his
country, the cause of mankind at heart, and makes that the scale in
which all other motives are weighed as in a balance. With this
inward prompter, he knows when to speak and when to hold his
tongue, when to temporise, and when to throw away the scabbard,
when to make men of service to principles, and when to make
principles the sole condition of popularity,—nearly as well as if he had
a title or a pension depending in reversion on his success: for it is
true that ‘in their generation the children of this world are wiser than
the children of light.’ In my opinion, Charles Fox had too much
of what we mean by ‘the milk of human kindness’ to be a practical
statesman, particularly in critical times, and with a cause of infinite
magnitude at stake. He was too easy a friend, and too generous an
enemy. He was willing to think better of those with whom he acted,
or to whom he was opposed, than they deserved. He was the
creature of temperament and sympathy, and suffered his feelings to
be played upon, and to get the better of his principles, which were
not of the most rigid kind—not ‘stuff o’ the conscience.’ With all
the power of the crown, and all the strongholds of prejudice and
venality opposed to him, ‘instead of a softness coming over the heart
of a man,’ he should (in such a situation) have ‘turned to the stroke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>his adamantine scales that feared no discipline of human hands,’ and
made it a struggle <i><span lang="la">ad internecionem</span></i> on the one side, as it was on the
other. There was no place for moderation, much less for huckstering
and trimming. Mr. Burke saw the thing right enough. It was
a question about a principle—about the existence or extinction of
human rights in the abstract. He was on the side of legitimate
slavery; Mr. Fox on that of natural liberty. That was no reason
he should be less bold or jealous in her defence, because he had every
thing to contend against. But he made too many coalitions, too
many compromises with flattery, with friendship, (to say nothing of
the baits of power) not to falter and be defeated at last in the noble
stand he had made for the principles of freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another sort are as much too captious and precise, as these are lax
and <em>cullible</em> in their notions of political warfare. Their fault is an
overweening egotism, as that of the former was too great a facility of
temper. They will have every thing their own way to the minutest
tittle, or they cannot think of giving it their sanction and support.
The cause must come to them, they will not go to the cause. They
stand upon their punctilio. They have a character at stake, which is
dearer to them than the whole world. They have an idea of perfect
truth and beauty in their own minds, the contemplation of which is
a never-failing source of delight and consolation to them,</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Though sun and moon were in the flat sea sunk,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>and which they will not soil by mixing it up with the infirmities of
any cause or any party. They will not, ‘to do a great right, do a
little wrong.’ They will let the lofty pillar inscribed to human liberty
fall to the ground sooner than extend a finger to save it, on account
of the dust and cobwebs that cling to it. It is not this great and
mighty object they are thinking of all the time, but their own fantastic
reputation and puny pretensions. While the world is tumbling about
our ears, and the last hold of liberty, the ark containing our birth-right,
the only possible barrier against barefaced tyranny, is tottering—instead
of setting the engines and the mortal instruments at work to
prop it, and fighting in the trenches to the last drop, they are washing
their hands of all imaginary imperfections, and looking in the glass of
their own vanity, with an air of heightened self-complacency. Alas!
they do not foresee the fatal consequences; they have an eye only to
themselves. While all the power, the prejudice, and ignorance of
mankind are drawn up in deadly array against the advance of truth
and justice, they owe it to themselves, forsooth! to state the naked
merits of the question (heat and passion apart) and pick out all the
faults of which their own party has been guilty, to fling as a make-weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>into the adversary’s scale of unmeasured abuse and execration.
They will not take their ready stand by the side of him who was ‘the
very arm and burgonet of man,’ and like a demi-Atlas, could alone
prop a declining world, because for themselves they have some objections
to the individual instrument, and they think principles more
important than persons. No, they think persons of more consequence
than principles, and themselves most of all. They injure the principle,
through the person most able to protect it. They betray the cause
by not defending it as it is attacked, tooth and nail, might and main,
without exception and without remorse. When every thing is at stake,
dear and valuable to man, as man; when there is but the one dreadful
alternative of entire loss, or final recovery of truth and freedom, it is
no time to stand upon trifles and moot-points; that great object is to
be secured first, and at all hazards.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is a third thing in their minds, a fanciful something
which they prefer to both contending parties. It may be so; but
neither they nor we can get it. We must have one of the two things
imposed upon us, not by choice but by hard necessity. ‘Our bane
and antidote are both before us:’ and if we do anything to neglect
the one, we justly incur the heavy, intolerable, unredeemed penalty of
the other. If our pride is stung, if we have received a blow or the
lie in our own persons, we know well enough what to do: our blood
is up, we have an actual feeling and object to satisfy; and we are not
to be diverted from our purpose by sophistry or mere words. The
quarrel is personal to ourselves; and we feel the whole stress of it,
rousing every faculty and straining every nerve. But if the quarrel is
general to mankind; if it is one in which the rights, freedom, hopes,
and happiness of the whole world are embarked; if we see the dignity
of our common nature prostrate, trampled upon and mangled before
the brute image of power, this gives us little concern; our reason
may disapprove, but our passions, our prejudices, are not touched; and
therefore our reason, our humanity, our abstract love of right (not
‘screwed to the sticking place’ by some paltry interest of our own)
are easily satisfied with any hollow professions of good-will, or put
off with vague excuses, or staggered with open defiance. We are
here, where a principle only is in danger, at leisure to calculate consequences,
prudently for ourselves, or favourably for others: were it
a point of honour (we think the honour of human nature is not our
honour, that its disgrace is not our disgrace—we are not the <em>rabble</em>!)
we should throw consideration and compassion to the dogs, and cry—‘Away
to Heaven respective lenity, and fire-eyed fury be my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>conduct now!’ But charity is cold. We are the dupes of the
flatteries of our opponents, because we are indifferent to our own
object: we stand in awe of their threats, because in the absence of
passion we are tender of our persons. They beat us in courage and in
intellect, because we have nothing but the common good to sharpen our
faculties or goad our will; they have no less an alternative in view
than to be uncontrolled masters of mankind, or to be hurled from high,—</p>

<p class='c016'>They do not celebrate the triumphs of their enemies as their own:
it is with them a more feeling disputation. They never give an inch
of ground that they can keep; they keep all that they can get; they
make no concessions that can redound to their own discredit; they
assume all that makes for them; if they pause, it is to gain time; if
they offer terms, it is to break them: they keep no faith with enemies:
if you relax in your exertions, they persevere the more: if you make
new efforts, they redouble theirs. While they give no quarter, you
stand upon more ceremony. While they are cutting your throat, or
putting the gag in your mouth, you talk of nothing but liberality,
freedom of inquiry, and <i><span lang="fr">douce humanité</span></i>. Their object is to destroy
you, your object is to spare them—to treat them according to your
own fancied dignity. They have sense and spirit enough to take all
advantages that will further their cause: you have pedantry and
pusillanimity enough to undertake the defence of yours, in order to
defeat it. It is the difference between the efficient and the inefficient;
and this again resolves itself into the difference between a speculative
proposition and a practical interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing that makes tyrants bold is, that they have the power to
justify their wrong. They lay their hands upon the sword, and ask
who will dispute their commands. The friends of humanity and
justice have not in general this ark of confidence to recur to, and can
only appeal to reason and propriety. They oppose power on the plea
of right and conscience; and shall they, in pursuance of their claims,
violate in the smallest tittle what is due to truth and justice? So
that the one have no law but their wills, and the absolute extent of
their authority, in attaining or securing their ends, because they make
no pretensions to scrupulous delicacy: the others are cooped and
cabined in, by all sorts of nice investigations in philosophy, and misgivings
of the moral sense; that is, are deprived or curtailed of the
means of succeeding in their ends, because those ends are not barefaced
violence and wrong. It might as well be said that a man has
a right to knock me on the head on the highway, and that I am only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>to use mildness and persuasion in return, as best suited to the justice
of my cause; as that I am not to retaliate and make reprisals on the
common enemies of mankind in their own style and mode of execution.
Is not a man to defend his liberty, or the liberties of his fellow-men,
as strenuously and remorselessly as he would his life or his purse?
Men are Quakers in political principle, Turks and Jews in private
conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole is an error, arising from confounding the distinction
between theory and practice, between the still-life of letters and the
tug and onset of contending factions. I might recommend to our
political mediators the advice which Henry <span class='fss'>V.</span> addressed to his soldiers
on a critical occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, in speculation, refine as much as you please, intellectually and
morally speaking, and you may do it with advantage. Reason is
then the instrument you use, and you cannot raise the standard of
perfection you fix upon and propose to others too high, or proceed
with too much candour and moderation in the advancement of truth:
but in practice, you have not your choice of ends or means. You
have two things to decide between, the extreme, probably, of an evil
and a considerable good, and if you will not make your mind up to
take the best of the two with all its disadvantages and draw-backs you
must be contented to take the worst: for as you cannot alter the state
of the conflicting parties who are carrying their point by force, or
dictate what is best by a word speaking; so by finding fault with the
attainable good, and throwing cold water on it, you add fuel to your
enemy’s courage and assist his success. ‘Those who are not for us
are against us.’ You create a diversion in his favour, by distracting
and enervating men’s minds, as much as by questioning the general’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>orders, or drawing off a strong detachment in the heat of a battle.
Political, is like military warfare. There are but two sides, and
after you have once chosen your party, it will not do to stand in the
midway, and say you like neither. There is no other to like, in the
eye of common sense, or in the practical and inevitable result of the
thing. As active partisans, we must take up with the best we can
get in the circumstances, and defend it with all our might against
a worse cause (which will prevail, if this does not) instead of ‘letting
our frail thoughts dally with faint surmise;’—or, while dreaming of
an ideal perfection, we shall find ourselves surprised into the train,
and gracing the triumph, of the common enemy. It is sufficient if our
objects and principles are sound and disinterested. If we were
engaged in a friendly contest, where integrity and fair dealing were
the order of the day, our means might be as unimpeachable as our
ends; but in a struggle with the passions, interests, and prejudices of
men, right reason, pure intention, are hardly competent to carry us
through: we want another stimulus. The vices may be opposed to
each other sometimes with advantage and propriety. A little of the
alloy of human frailty may be allowed to lend its aid to the service of
humanity; and if we have only so much obstinacy or insensibility as
enables us to persevere in the path of public duty with more determination
and effect, both our motives and conduct will be above the
ordinary standard of political morality. To suppose that we can do
much more than this, or that we can set up our individual opinion of
what is best in itself, or of the best means of attaining it, and be
listened to by the world at large, is egregiously to overrate their
docility or our own powers of persuasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the same want of a centripetal force, of a ruling passion, of a
moral instinct of union and co-operation for a general purpose, that
makes men fly off into knots and factions, and each set up for the
leader of a party himself. Where there is a strong feeling of interest
at work, it reconciles and combines the most discordant materials,
and fits them to their place in the social machine. But in the conduct
and support of the public good, we see ‘nothing but vanity, chaotic
vanity.’ There is no forbearance, no self-denial, no magnanimity of
proceeding. Every one is seeking his own aggrandisement, or to
supplant his neighbour, instead of advancing the popular cause. It
is because they have no real regard for it but as it serves as a stalking-horse
to their ambition, restless inquietude, or love of cabal. They
abuse and vilify their own party, just as they do the Ministers.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>John Bull does not aim so maliciously, or hit so hard at Whigs and
Reformers, as Cobbett. The reason is, that a very large proportion
of these Marplots and regenerators of the world are actuated by no
love of their species or zeal for a general question, but by envy,
malice, and all uncharitableness. They are discontented with themselves
and with every thing about them. They object to, they
dissent from every measure. Nothing pleases their fastidious tastes.
For want of something to exercise their ill-humour and troublesome
officiousness upon, they abuse the Government:—when they are
baulked or tired of this they fall foul of one another. The slightest
slip or difference of opinion is never forgiven, but gives birth to a
deadly feud. Touch but their petty self-importance, and out comes
a flaming denunciation of their own cabal, and all they know about
the individuals composing it. This is not patriotism, but spleen—a
want of something to do and to talk about—of sense, honesty, and
feeling. To wreak their spite on an individual, they will ruin the
cause, and serve up the friend and idol of the people sliced and
carbonadoed, a delicious morsel to the other side. There is a strange
want of keeping in this. They are true neither to themselves nor
to their principles. The Reformers are in general, it must be
confessed, an ill-conditioned set; and they should be told of this
infirmity that most easily besets them. When they find their gall
and bitterness overflowing on the very persons who take the lead,
and deservedly take the lead, in their affairs, for some slight flaw or
misunderstanding, they should be taught to hold their tongues, or be
drummed out of the regiment as spies and informers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trimming, and want of spirit to declare the honest truth, arise
in part from the same source. When a man is not thoroughly
convinced of an opinion, or where he does not feel a deep interest
in it, he does not like to make himself obnoxious by avowing it;
is willing to make all the allowance he can for difference of
sentiment, and consults his own safety by retiring from a sinking
cause. This is the very time when the genuine partisan, who has
a rooted attachment to a principle, and feels it as a part of himself,
finds himself most called upon to come forward in its support. His
anxiety for truth and justice leaves him in no fear for himself, and
the sincerity of his motives makes him regardless of censure or
obloquy. His profession of hearty devotion to freedom was not an
ebullition called forth by the sunshine of prosperity, a lure for
popularity and public favour; and when these desert it, he still
maintains his post with his integrity. There is a natural timidity
of mind, also, which can never go the whole length of any opinion,
but is always interlarding its qualified assent with unmeaning <em>buts</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>and <em>ifs</em>; as there is a levity and discursiveness of imagination which
cannot settle finally in any belief, and requires a succession of
glancing views, topics, and opposite conclusions, to satisfy its appetite
for intellectual variety. I have known persons leave the cause of
independence and freedom, not because they found it unprofitable,
but because they found it flat and stale for want of novelty. At the
same time, interest is a great stimulator; and perhaps the success of
their early principles might have reconciled them to their embarrassing
monotony. Few persons have strength and simplicity of mind
(without some additional inducement) to be always harping on the
same string, or to put up with the legitimate variety to be found in
an abstract principle, applicable to all emergencies. They like
changeable silks better than lasting homespun. A sensible man
once mentioned to me his having called on —— that morning, who
entertained him with a <em>tirade</em> against the Bourbons for two hours;
but he said he did not at all feel convinced that he might not have
been writing Ultra-royalist paragraphs for the ——, just before he
came, in their favour, and only shifted his side of the argument, as
a man who is tired of lying too long on one side of his body is glad
to turn to the other. There was much shrewdness, and equal probability
in this conjecture.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think the spirit of partisanship is of use in a point of view that
has not been distinctly adverted to. It serves as a conductor to carry
off our antipathies and ill-blood in a quarter and a manner that is
least hurtful to the general weal. A thorough partisan is a good
hater; but he hates only one side of a question, and that the <em>outside</em>.
His bigotry throws human nature into strong light and shade; he has
his sympathies as well as his antipathies; it is not all black or a dull
drab-colour. He does not generalise in his contempt or disgust, or
proceed from individuals to universals. He lays the faults and vices
of mankind to the account of sects and parties, creeds and classes.
Man in himself is a good sort of animal. It is the being a Tory or
a Whig (as it may happen) that makes a man a knave or fool; but
then we hardly look upon him as of the same species with ourselves.
Kings are not arbitrary, nor priests hypocritical, because they are
men, but because they are kings and priests. We form certain
nominal abstractions of these classes, which the more we dislike
them, the less natural do they seem, and leave the general character
of the species untouched, or act as a foil to it. There is nothing
that is a greater damper to party spirit than to suggest that the errors
and enormities of both sides arise from certain inherent dispositions,
common to the species. It shocks the liberal and enlightened among
us, to suppose that under any circumstances they could become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>bigots, tools, persecutors. They wipe their hands clean of all such
aspersions. There is a great gulph of prejudice and passion placed
between us and our opponents; and this is interpreted into a natural
barrier and separation of sentiment and feeling. ‘Our withers are
unwrung.’ Burke represented modern revolutionists to himself, under
the equivocal similitude of ‘green-eyed, spring-nailed, velvet-pawed
philosophers, whether going on two legs or on four;’ and thus
removed to a distance from his own person all the ill attributes with
which he had complimented the thorough-bred metaphysician. By
comparing the plausible qualities of a Minister of state to the sleekness
of the panther, I myself seem to have no more affinity with
that whole genus, than with the whiskers and claws of that formidable
and spirited animal. Bishop Taylor used to reprimand his rising
pride by saying, at the sight of a reprobate, ‘There goes my wicked
self:’ we do not apply the same method politically, and say, ‘There
goes my Tory or my Jacobin self.’ We suppose the two things
incompatible. The Calvinist damns the Arminian, the Protestant
the Papist, &#38;c. but it is not for a difference of nature, but an opposition
of opinion. The spirit of partizanship is not a spirit of our
misanthropy. But for the vices and errors of example and institution,
mankind are (on this principle) only a little lower than the angels:
it is false doctrine and absurd prejudices that make demons of them.
The only original sin is differing in opinion with us: of that they
are curable like any occasional disorder, and the man comes out,
from beneath the husk of his party and prejudices, pure and immaculate.
Make proselytes of them, let them come over to our way of
thinking, and they are a different race of beings quite. This is to be
effected by the force of argument and the progress of knowledge.
It is well, it is perfectly well. We cast the slough of our vices with
the shibboleth of our party; a Reform in Parliament would banish all
knavery and folly from the land. It is not the same wretched little
mischievous animal, man, that is alike under all denominations and
all systems, and in whom different situations and notions only bring
out different inherent, incorrigible vices and propensities; but the
professions and the theory being changed for the one, which we
think the only true and infallible one, the whole world, by the mere
removal of our arbitrary prejudices and modes of thinking, would
become as sincere, as benevolent, as independent, and as worthy
people as we are! To hate and proscribe half the species under
various pretexts and nicknames, seems, therefore, the only way to
entertain a good opinion of ourselves and mankind in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not the best, nor is it the worst (the worst is good enough
for us) of the Scotch Novels. There is a story in it, an interest
excited almost from the first, a clue which you get hold of and wish
to follow out; a mystery to be developed, and which does not
disappoint you at last. After you once get into the stream, you
read on with eagerness, and have only to complain of the number
of impediments and diversions thrown in your way. The author
is evidently writing to gain time, to make up his complement of
volumes, his six thousand guineas worth of matter; and to get to
the end of your journey, and satisfy the curiosity he has raised, you
must be content to travel with him, stop when he stops, and turn out
of the road as often as he pleases. He dallies with your impatience,
and smiles in your face, but you cannot, and dare not be angry with
him, while with his giant-hand he plays at pushpin with the reader,
and sweeps the rich stakes from the table. He has, they say, got
a <em>plum</em> by his writings. What have not the public got by reading
them? The course of exchange is, and will be, in our favour, as
long as he gives us one volume for ourselves, and two for himself.
Who is there that has not been the better, the wiser, and happier
man for these fine and inexhaustible productions of genius? The
more striking characters and situations are not quite so highly
wrought up in the present, as in some former instances, nor are they
so crowded, so thickly sown. But the genius of the author is not
exhausted, nor can it be so till not a Scotch superstition, or popular
tradition is left, or till the pen drops lifeless and regretted from its
master’s hand. Ah! who will then call the mist from its hill?
Who will make the circling eddies roar? Who, with his ‘so potent
art,’ will dim the sun, or stop the winds, that wave the forest-heads,
in their course? Who will summon the spirits of the northern air
from their chill abodes, or make gleaming lake or hidden cavern
teem with wizard, or with elfin forms? There is no one but the
Scottish Prospero, but old Sir Walter, can do the trick aright. He
is the very genius of the clime—mounts in her old grey clouds, dips
in her <em>usquebaugh</em> and whiskey!—startles you with her antique Druid
spells in the person of Elshie, or stirs up the fierce heat of her
theological fires with Macbriar and Kettle-drumle: sweeps the
country with a far war-cry to Lochiel, or sighs out the soul of love
in the perfumed breath of the Lily of St. Leonard’s. Stand thou,
then, Meg Merrilies, on the point of thy fated rock, with wild locks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>and words streaming to the wind; and sit thou there in thy narrow
recess, Balfour of Burley, betwixt thy Bible and thy sword, thy
arm of flesh and arm of the Spirit:—when the last words have
passed the lips of the author of Waverley, there will be none to
re-kindle your fires, or recall your spirit! Let him write on then
to the last drop of ink in his ink-stand, even though it should not
be made according to the model of that described by Mr. Coleridge,
and we will not be afraid to read whatever he is not ashamed to
publish. We are the true and liege subjects of his pen, and profess
our ultra-fealty in this respect, like the old French leaguers, with a
<i><span lang="fr">Quand même</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pirate is not what we expected, nor is it new. We had
looked for a prodigious <em>row</em>—landing and boarding, cut and thrust,
blowing up of ships, and sacking of sea-ports, with the very devil to
pay, and a noise to deafen clamour,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>‘Guns, drums, trumpets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blunderbusses and thunder.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We supposed that for the time ‘Hell itself would be empty, and
all the devils be here.’ <em>There be land pirates and water pirates</em>; and
we thought Sir Walter would be for kicking up just such a dust by
sea, in the Buccaneers, (as it was to be called) as he has done by
land in Old Mortality. <i><span lang="la">Multum abludit imago.</span></i> There is nothing or
little of the sort. There is here (bating a sprinkling of twenty pages
of roaring lads, who come on shore for no use but to get themselves
hanged in the Orkneys,) only a single Pirate, a peaking sort of gentleman,
spiteful, but not enterprising; in love, and inclined to take up
and reform, but very equivocal in the sentiments he professes, and in
those he inspires in others. Cleveland is the Pirate, who is wrecked
off the coast of Zetland, is saved from destruction by young Mordaunt
Mertoun, who had been so far the hero of the piece, and jilts him
with his mistress, Minna, a grave sentimentalist, and the elder of two
sisters, to whom Mordaunt had felt a secret and undeclared passion.
The interest of the novel hinges on this <em>bizarre</em> situation of the
different parties. Sir Walter (for he has in the present work leisure
on his hands to philosophize) here introduces a dissertation of some
length, but not much depth, to show that the jilting of favoured, or
half-favoured lovers, comes by the dispensation of Providence, and
that the breed of honest men and bonny lasses would be spoiled if the
fairest of the fair, the sentimental Miss, and the prude (contrary to all
previous and common-place calculation), did not prefer the blackguard
and the bravo, to the tender, meek, puny, unpretending, heartbroken
lover. We do not think our novelist manages his argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>well, or shines in his new Professor’s chair of morality. Miss Polly
Peachum, we do indeed remember, the artless, soft, innocent Polly,
fell in love with the bold Captain Macheath; but so did Miss Lucy
Lockitt too, who was no chicken, and who, according to this new
balance of power in the empire of love, ought to have tempered her
fires with the phlegm of some young chaplain to the prison, or the soft
insinuations of some dreaming poet. But as our author himself is not
in a hurry to get on with his story, we will imitate him, and let him
speak here in his superfluous character of a casuist, or commentator
on his own narrative.</p>

<p class='c007'>[A long passage from Chap, <span class='fss'>XIII.</span>, beginning ‘Captain Cleveland
sate betwixt the sisters,’ follows.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Suffice it to say, that we differ from this solution of the difficulty,
ingenious and old as it is; and to justify that opinion, ask only whether
such a man as Cleveland would not be a general favourite with women,
instead of being so merely with those of a particularly retired and
fantastic character, which destroys the author’s balance of qualities in
love? Indeed, his own story is a very bad illustration of his doctrine;
for this romantic and imprudent attachment of the gentle and sensitive
Minna to the bold and profligate Captain Cleveland leads to nothing
but the most disastrous consequences; and the opposition between
their sentiments and characters, which was to make them fit partners
for life, only prevents the possibility of their union, and renders both
parties permanently miserable. Besides, the whole perplexity is, after
all, gratuitous. The enmity between Cleveland and young Mertoun
(the chief subject of the plot) is founded on their jealousy of each
other in regard to Minna, and yet there had been no positive engagement
between her and Mertoun, who, like Edmund in Lear, is equally
betrothed to both sisters—in the end marrying the one that he as
well as the reader likes least. Afterwards, when the real character
of this gay rover of the seas is more fully developed, and he gets into
scrapes with the police of Orkney, the grave, romantic Minna, like a
true northern lass, deserts him, and plays off a little old-fashioned,
unavailing, but discreet morality upon him. When the reader begins
to sympathise with ‘a brave man in distress,’ then is the time for his
mistress with ‘the pale face and raven locks’ to look to her own
character. We like the theory of the Beggar’s Opera better than
this: the ladies there followed their supposed hero, their <i><span lang="fr">beau ideal</span></i>
of a lover, to prison, instead of leaving him to his untoward fate.
Minna is no <span class='fss'>NUT-BROWN MAID</span>, though she has a passion for outlaws,
between whose minds and those of the graver and more reflecting of
the fair sex there is, according to the opinion of our <span class='fss'>GREAT UNKNOWN</span>, a
secret and pre-established harmony. What is still more extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>and unsatisfactory in the progress of the story is this—all the pretended
preternatural influence of Norna of the Fitful-Head, the most
potent and impressive personage in the drama, is exerted to defeat
Cleveland’s views, and to give Minna to Mordaunt Mertoun, for
whom she conceives an instinctive and anxious attachment as her
long-lost son; and yet in the end the whole force of this delusion,
and the reader’s sympathies, are destroyed by the discovery that
Cleveland, not Mertoun, is her real offspring, and that she has been
equally led astray by her maternal affection and preternatural pretensions.
Does this great writer of romances, this profound historiographer
of the land of visions and of second sight, thus mean to
qualify his thrilling mysteries—to <em>back</em> out of his thrice-hallowed
prejudices, and to turn the tables upon us with modern cant and
philosophic scepticism? That is the last thing we could forgive him!</p>

<p class='c007'>We have said that the characters of the Pirate are not altogether
new. Norna, the enchantress, whom he is ‘so fond’ at last to
depose from her <em>ideal</em> cloudy throne of spells and mystic power, is
the Meg Merrilies of the scene. She passes over it with vast strides,
is at hand whenever she is wanted, sits hatching fate on the topmost
tower that overlooks the wilderness of waves, or glides suddenly from
a subterraneous passage, and in either case moulds the elements of
nature, and the unruly passions of men, to her purposes. She has
‘strange power of speech,’ weaves events with words, is present
wherever she pleases, and performs what she wills, and yet she doubts
her own power, and criticises her own pretensions. Meg Merrilies
was an honester witch. She at least stuck true to herself. We hate
anything by halves; and most of all, imagination and superstition
piece-meal. Cleveland, again, is a sort of inferior <em>Gentle Geordie</em>, and
Minna lags after Effie Deans, the victim of misplaced affection, but
far, far behind. Wert thou to live a thousand years, and write a
thousand romances, thou wouldst never, old True-penny, beat thy
own <cite>Heart of Mid Lothian</cite>! It is for that we can forgive thee all
that thou didst mean to write in the <span class='sc'>Beacon</span>, or hast written elsewhere,
beneath the dignity of thy genius and knowledge of man’s
weaknesses, as well as better nature! Magnus Troil is a great name,
a striking name; but we <em>ken</em> his person before; he is of the same
genealogy as the Bailie Braidwardine, and other representatives of
old Scottish hospitality; the dwarf Nick Strumpfer is of a like
familiar breed, only uglier and more useless than any former one:
we have even traces, previous to the Pirate, of the extraordinary
agriculturist and projector, Mr. Timothy Yellowley, and his sister,
Miss Barbara Yellowley, with pinched nose and grey eyes; but we
confess we have one individual who was before a stranger to us, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>least in these parts, namely, Claud Halcro, the poet, and friend of
‘Glorious John.’ We do not think him in his place amidst dwarfs,
witches, pirates, and <em>Udallers</em>; and his stories of the Wits’ Coffee-house
and Dryden’s poetry are as tedious to the critical reader as
they are to his Zetland patron and hearers. We might confirm this
opinion by a quotation, but we should be thought too tedious. He
fills up, we will venture to say, a hundred pages of the work with
sheer impertinence, with <em>pribble prabble</em>. Whenever any serious
matter is to be attended to, Claud Halcro pulls out his fiddle and
draws the long bow, and repeats some verses of ‘<cite>Glorious John</cite>.’
Bunce, the friend of Cleveland, is much better; for we can conceive
how a strolling-player should turn gentleman-rover in a time of need,
and the foppery and finery of the itinerant stage-hero become the
quarter-deck exceedingly well. In general, however, our author’s
humour requires the aid of costume and dialect to set it off to
advantage: his wit is Scotch, not English wit. It must have the
<em>twang</em> of the uncouth pronunciation and peculiar manners of the
country in it. The elder Mertoun is a striking misanthropic sketch;
but it is not very well made out in what his misanthropy originates,
nor to what it tends. He is merely a part of the machinery: neither
is he the first gentleman in these Novels who lands without an introduction
on the remote shores of Scotland, and shuts himself up (for
reasons best known to himself) in inaccessible and solitary confinement.
We had meant to give the outline of the story of the Pirate,
but we are ill at a plot, and do not care to blunt the edge of the
reader’s curiosity by anticipating each particular. As far, however,
as relates to the historical foundation of the narrative, the author has
done it to our hands, and we give his words as they stand in the
<cite>Advertisement</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Nearly the whole of the Advertisement is quoted.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the execution of these volumes we need hardly speak. It is
inferior, but it is only inferior to some of his former works. Whatever
he touches, we see the hand of a master. He has only to
describe action, thoughts, scenes, and they everywhere speak, breathe,
and live. It matters not whether it be a calm sea-shore, a mountain
tempest, a drunken brawl, the ‘Cathedral’s choir and gloom,’ the
Sybil’s watch-tower, or the smuggler’s cave; the things are immediately
there that we should see, hear, and feel. He is Nature’s
Secretary. He neither adds to, nor takes away from her book; and
that makes him what he is, the most popular writer living. We
might give various instances of his unrivalled undecaying power, but
shall select only one or two with which we were most struck and
delighted in the perusal. The characters of the two sisters, daughters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>of Magnus Troil, and the heroines of the tale, are thus beautifully
drawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Here follows the description of Minna and Brenda, from
Chap. <span class='fss'>III.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>So much for elegant Vandyke portrait-painting. Now for something
of the Salvator style. Norna, the terrific and unhappy Norna,
is thus finely introduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The first introduction of Norna is quoted from Chap. <span class='fss'>V.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>We give one more extract in a different style; and we think the
comic painting in it is little inferior to Hogarth’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>[A passage, beginning ‘Now the fortunate arrival of Mordaunt,’ &#38;c.
is quoted from Chap. <span class='fss'>XI.</span>]</p>

<p class='c007'>Shall we go on? No, but will leave the reader to revel at ease in
the luxuries of feeling and description scattered through the rest of
the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have only time to add two remarks more, which we do not
remember to have seen made. One relates to the exquisitely good-natured
and liberal tone displayed in the author’s quotations from
living writers. He takes them every one by turns, and of all
factions in poetry and politics, under his wing, and sticks a stanza
from Coleridge, from Wordsworth, from Byron, from Crabbe, from
Rogers, as a motto to his chapters, not jealous of their popularity, nor
disdaining their obscurity. The author can hardly guess how much
we like him for this. The second thing we would advert to is a fault,
and a remarkable one. It is the slovenliness of the style and badness
of the grammar throughout these admirable productions. Badness of
the grammar! Slovenly style! What do you mean by that?
Take a few instances, and we have done with the subject for ever.
We give them <em>seriatim</em>, as we marked them in the margin.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘Here Magnus proceeded with great <em>animation</em>, sipping from <em>time</em> to
<em>time</em> the half diluted spirit, which at the same <em>time animated</em> his
resentment against the intruders,’ etc. P. 16.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘In those days (for the <em>present</em> times are greatly altered for the
better) the <em>presence</em> of a superior in such a situation,’ etc. P. 21.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘The <em>information</em>, which she acquired by habits of patient attention,
<em>were</em> indelibly rivetted in a naturally powerful memory.’ P. 48.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘And I know not <em>whom</em> else are expected.’ P. 56.</p>

<p class='c006'>‘Or perhaps he <em>preferred</em> the situation, of the house and farm which
he himself was to occupy (which indeed was a tolerable one) as
<em>preferable</em> to that, etc.’ P. 89.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>‘The <em>strength</em> of the retiring wave proved even <em>stronger</em> than he had
expected,’ etc. P. 169.</p>

<p class='c006'>But let us have done with this, and leave it to the Editor of the
Quarterly Review to take up the subject as a mighty important little
discovery of his own!</p>

<p class='c007'>The author of Waverley is here himself again; and it is on English
ground that he has come upon his feet. Peveril of the Peak is all but
equal to the best of the <span class='sc'>Scotch Novels</span>. It is no weaving up of old
odds and ends; no lazy repetition of himself at second-hand, and <em>the
worse for the wear</em>. Peveril is all new, good,<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c009'><sup>[65]</sup></a> full of life, spirit,
character, bustle, incident, and expectation; nothing is wanting to
make it quite equal to the very best of his former productions, but
that it has not the same intense interest, nor the same preternatural
and overpowering imagery. Fenella, a deaf and dumb dwarf,
attached to the Countess of Derby, is, indeed, an exquisitely drawn
character, and exerts a sort of quaint, apparently magic influence over
the scene; but her connection with it is so capricious, so ambiguous,
and at last so improbable, as to produce or to leave none of those
thrilling and awe-struck impressions which were so irresistibly interwoven
with some former delineations of the same kind. But as a
sketch, as a picture, the little fairy attendant of the Queen of Man is
one of the most beautiful and interesting the author ever struck out
with his enchanting and enchanted pencil. The present Novel comes
the nearest to <span class='sc'>Old Mortality</span>, both in the class of subjects of which
it treats, and in the indefatigable spirit and hurried movement of the
execution. It differs from that noble master-piece in this, that Sir
Walter (or whoever else, in the devil’s name, it is) has not infused
the same depth or loftiness of sentiment into his English Roundheads
and Cavaliers, as into his Scotch Covenanters and Royalists; that
the characters are left more in the outlines and dead colouring; and
though the incidents follow one another as rapidly, and have great
variety and contrast, there is not the same accumulation of interest,
the same thickening of the plot, nor the same thronging together of
eager and complicated groups upon the canvas. His English imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>is not so fully peopled with character, manners, and sentiment,
as his Scotch understanding is; but, by the mass, they are not ‘thinly
scattered to make up a show.’ There is <em>cut and come again</em>. We
say this the more willingly, because we were among those who
conceived there was a falling off, a <em>running to seed</em>, in some of the
later productions of the author. The <span class='sc'>Fortunes of Nigel</span> showed a
resuscitation in his powers; that is, a disposition to take new ground,
and proceed with real pains and unabated vigour; and in his Peveril,
we think he has completed his victory over excusable idleness and an
inexcusable disregard of reputation. He may now go on upon a fresh
lease, and write ten more Novels, just as good or as bad as he pleases!</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two things that we used to admire of old in this author,
and that we have had occasion to admire anew in the present instance,
the extreme life of mind or naturalness displayed in the descriptions,
and the magnanimity and freedom from bigotry and prejudice shewn in
the drawing of the characters. This last quality is the more remarkable,
as the reputed author is accused of being a thorough-paced
partisan in his own person,—intolerant, mercenary, mean; a professed
toad-eater, a sturdy hack, a pitiful retailer or suborner of infamous
slanders, a literary Jack Ketch, who would greedily sacrifice any one
of another way of thinking as a victim to prejudice and power, and
yet would do it by other hands, rather than appear in it himself.
Can this be all true of the author of Waverley; and does he deal out
such fine and heaped justice to all sects and parties in time past?
Perhaps (if so) one of these extremes accounts for the other; and,
as ‘he knows all qualities with a learned spirit,’ probably he may be
aware of this practical defect in himself, and be determined to shew
to posterity, that when his own interest was not concerned, he was as
free from that nauseous and pettifogging bigotry, as a mere matter of
speculation, as any man could be. As a novel-writer, he gives the
devil his due, and he gives no more to a saint. He treats human
nature scurvily, yet handsomely; that is, much as it deserves; and,
if it is the same person who is the author of the Scotch novels, and
who has a secret moving hand in certain Scotch Newspapers and
Magazines, we may fairly characterize him as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The wisest, <em>meanest</em> of mankind.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among other characters in the work before us, is that of Ned
Christian, a cold-blooded hypocrite, pander, and intriguer; yet a
man of prodigious talent,—of great versatility,—of unalterable self-possession
and good humour, and with a power to personate agreeably,
and to the life, any character he pleased. Might not such a man
have written the Scotch Novels?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>It has been suggested, with great modesty, that the Author of
Waverley was like Shakspeare. We beg leave with equal modesty to
suggest another comparison, which we think much nearer the mark;
and that is, to the writings of Mr. Cobbett. The peculiarity of
Shakspeare’s mind is (we humbly apprehend) that sort of power
which completely levels the distinction between imagination and
reality. His mind properly has wings, and it is indifferent to him
whether he treads the air or walks the earth. He makes us
acquainted with things we did not know before, as if we knew them
familiarly. Now Sir Walter Scott only recals to us what we already
knew—he deals wholly in realities, or what are commonly received
as such; and so does Mr. Cobbett. Both are downright matter-of-fact
minds, and have little, if any, of that power which throws into
objects more than ordinary opinion or feeling connects with them.
Naturalness is the <em>forte</em> of both these writers. They have a strong,
vivid, bodily perception (so to speak), a material intuition of what
they write about. All their ideas are concrete, and not abstracted.
Mention an old, dilapidated castle, and a thriving, substantial brick
mansion to Sir Walter Scott, and he immediately has an actual image
of some such objects conjured up in his mind, and describes them as
he has seen them, with all their local circumstances, and so as to
bring back some similar recollection to the reader’s mind, as if there
had been just two such buildings in the place where he was brought up.
But this revived reality is all; there is no new light thrown
upon the subject. It is a sort of poetic memory. Good. So set
Mr. Cobbett to work upon the subject of our agricultural distress, and
with quite as much poetry, as much of the picturesque, and in as good
English as Sir Walter Scott writes Scotch, he will describe you to
the life a turnip-field with the green sprouts glittering in the sun,
the turnips frozen to a mere clod, the breath of the oxen steaming
near that are biting it, and the dumb patience of the silly sheep. We
should like to know whether he is not as great a hand at this sort of
ocular demonstration as Sir Walter himself? He shall describe a
Scotch heath, or an American wilderness against Sir Walter for a
thousand pounds. Then for character; who does it with more
master-strokes, with richer gusto, or a greater number of palpable hits
than the Editor of the Political Register? Again, as to pathos, let
Mr. Cobbett tell a story of a pretty servant girl or soldier’s wife,
left by her sweetheart, or shot dead in his arms, and see if he will not
come near the <cite>Heart of Mid Lothian</cite>? You may say it is not this or
that, it is coarse, low, the man has no feeling, but it is nature, and
that’s quite enough. The truth is, these two original geniuses have
found out a secret; they write as they feel. It is just like school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>boys being able to read as they would talk. It is a very awkward
difficulty to get over, but being once accomplished, the effect is
prodigious. Then, there is the same strong sarcastic vein of <em>roystering</em>
pot-house humour in the one as in the other; and as for giving
both sides of a question, nobody has done that more effectually than
Mr. Cobbett in the course of his different writings. His style also is
as good, nay, far better: and if it should be said that Mr. Cobbett
sometimes turns blackguard, it cannot be affirmed that he is a cat’s
paw—which is the <i><span lang="fr">dernier resort</span></i> of humanity, into which Sir Walter
has retreated, and shuts himself up in it impregnably as in a fortress.
To conclude this parallel, we will be bold to say in illustration of our
argument, that there is hardly a single page in the Scotch Novels
which Mr. Cobbett could not write, if he set his mind to it; and
there is not a single page in Shakspeare, either the best or the worst,
which he <em>could</em> write for his life, and let him try ever so. Such is
the genius of the three men.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much by way of preface to our account of the most magnanimous
Peveril of the Peak, and now for extracts. We have not time
or limits to give the story, which, however, relates to the Civil Wars
of England; but we shall furnish our readers with a specimen of the
spirit with which it is written; it is the description of the meeting of
Peveril with the dwarf Fenella, where she tries to prevent his going
to meet Alice Bridgenorth at the Goddard Crovann-stone in the Isle
of Man.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The whole of Chap. <span class='fss'>XVI.</span> of <cite>Peveril of the Peak</cite> is set out].</p>

<p class='c006'>We have been led to such length by the beauty of this description
that we have not room for another extract, or we would give that
master-piece of wit and irony, the scene where Peveril meets with
Ganlesse and Smith at a low alehouse, on his route through
Derbyshire.</p>

the masters and the slaves.</p>

<p class='c006'>III. Do I not feel this from the least shadow of restraint, of
obligation, of dependence? Why then do I complain? I have had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>nothing to do all my life but to think, and have enjoyed the objects
of thought, the sense of truth and beauty, in perfect integrity of soul.
No one has said to me, <em>Believe this, do that, say what we would
have you</em>; no one has come between me and my free-will; I have
breathed the very air of truth and independence. Compared with
this unbiassed, uncontrouled possession of the universe of thought and
nature, what I have wanted is light in the balance, and hardly claims
the tribute of a sigh. Oh! Liberty, what a mistress art thou!
Have I not enjoyed thee as a bride, and drank thy spirit as of a
wine-cup, and will yet do so to my latest breath!</p>

<p class='c006'>IV. But is not Liberty dangerous, and self-will excessive? I do
not think so: for those who are not governed by their own feelings
are led away by prejudice or interest; and reason is a safer guide

beauty. I wonder over it, I detect each hidden grace, I revel and
luxuriate in it, without any doubts or misgivings. Is not this to be
master of it and of myself? But is the picture mine? No—oh!
yes, ten times over!</p>

<p class='c006'>VI. That thing, <em>a lie</em>, has never come near my soul. I know not
what it is to fear to think or to say what I think.</p>

<p class='c006'>VII. I am choked, pent up in any other atmosphere but this. I
cannot imagine how kings and courtiers contrive to exist. I could
no more live without daring to speak, to look, to feel what I thought,
than I could hold in my breath for any length of time. Nor
could I bear to debar others of this privilege. Were it not that the
Great would play the part of slaves themselves, they would hate to
be surrounded with nothing but slaves, and to see meanness and
hypocrisy crawling before them, as much as we do to see a spider
crawling in our path.</p>

<p class='c006'>VIII. I never knew what it was to feel like a footman. How
many lords in waiting can say as much?</p>

does not insult and triumph over them. This is a great mistake.</p>

<p class='c006'>XII. For a man to be a coxcomb, shews a want of imagination.
No one will ever pride himself on his beauty who has studied the
head of the Antinous, or be in danger of running into the excess of
the fashion, who has any knowledge of the Antique. The <em>ideal</em> is
incompatible with personal vanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>XIII. A scholar is like a book written in a dead language—it is
not every one that can read in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>XIV. Just as much as we see in others, we have in ourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>XV. A painter gives only his own character in a portrait, whether
grave or gay, gross or refined, wise or foolish. Even in copying a
head, there is some difficulty in making the features unlike our own.
A person with a low forehead or a short chin puts a constraint upon
himself in painting a high forehead or a long chin. So much has
sympathy to do with the operations both of the eye and the hand,
with observation and practice!</p>

<p class='c006'>XVI. People at a play hiss an unsuccessful author or actor, as if
the latter had committed some heinous crime—he has committed the
greatest crime, that of setting up a superiority over us which he has
failed to make good.</p>

<p class='c006'>XVII. The rich, who do nothing themselves, represent idleness
as the greatest crime. They have reason: it is necessary that some
one should do something.</p>

<p class='c006'>XVIII. What a pity that kings and great men do not write
books, instead of mere authors! What superior views they must
have of things, and how the world would be benefited by the
communication!</p>

<p class='c006'>XIX. The greatest proof of superiority is to bear with impertinence.</p>

<p class='c006'>XX. No truly great man ever thought himself so.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXII. Abuse is an indirect species of homage.</p>

world, all the rest of mankind seem equal.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXIV. It is a bad style that requires frequent <em>breaks</em> and marks
of admiration.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXV. It happens in conversation as in different games. One
person seems to excel, till another does better, and we then think no
more of the first.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXVI. Those who can keep secrets, have no curiosity. We
only wish to gain knowledge, that we may impart it.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXVII. Genius is native to the soil where it grows—is fed by
the air, and warmed by the sun—and is not a hot-house plant or an
exotic.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXVIII. All truly great works of art are <em>national</em> in their
character and origin.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXIX. People are distinguished less by a genius for any particular
thing, than by a peculiar tone and manner of feeling and thinking,
whatever be the subject. The same qualities of mind or characteristic
excellence that a man shows in one art, he would probably have
displayed in any other. I have heard Mr. Northcote say, that he
thought Sir Joshua Reynolds would have written excellent genteel
comedies. His <cite>Discourses</cite> certainly are bland and amiable (rather
than striking or original) like his pictures.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXX. The same kind of excellence may be observed to prevail
in different arts at the same period of time, as characteristic of the
spirit of the age. Fielding and Hogarth were cotemporaries.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXI. There is an analogy in the style of certain authors to
certain professions. One writes like a lawyer: it seems as if another
would have made an eminent physician. Mandeville said of Addison
that he was ‘a parson in a tye-wig:’ and there is something in <cite>The
Spectator</cite> to justify this description of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXII. Salvator Rosa paints like a soldier; Nicholas Poussin
like a professor at a University; Guido like a finished gentleman;
Parmegiano with something of the air of a dancing master. Alas!
Guido was a gamester and a madman; and Parmegiano a searcher
after the philosopher’s stone. One of the happiest ideas in modern
criticism was that of designating different living poets by the cups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>Apollo gives them to drink out of: thus Wordsworth is made to
drink out of a wooden bowl, Lord Byron out of a skull chased with
silver, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXIII. Extreme impatience and irritability are often combined
with a corresponding degree of indifference and indolence. When
the eagerness of pursuit or the violence of opposition ceases, nothing
is left to interest the mind, that has been once accustomed to a state
of morbid excitement.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXIV. Artists and other studious professions are not happy,
for this reason: they cannot enjoy mental repose. A state of
lassitude and languor succeeds to that of overstrained, anxious
exertion.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXV. It is the custom at present to exclude all but Scientific
and Mechanical subjects from our fashionable Public Institutions, lest
any allusions to popular sentiments or the cause of humanity should
by chance creep in, to the great annoyance of the polite and well-informed
part of the audience.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXVI. People had much rather be thought to look ill than
old: because it is possible to recover from sickness, but there is no
recovering from age.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXVII. I never knew but one person who had a passion for
truth—and only one who had the same regard to the distinction
between right and wrong, that others have to their own interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXVIII. Women are the sport of caprice, the slaves of custom.</p>

<p class='c006'>XXXIX. When men are not favourites with women, it is either
from habits of vulgar debauchery, or from constitutional indifference,
or from an overstrained and pedantic idea of the sex, taken from
books, and answering to nothing in real life.</p>

<p class='c006'>XL. The object of books is to teach us ignorance; that is, to
throw a veil over nature, and persuade us that things are not what
they are, but what the writer fancies or wishes them to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLI. My little boy said the other day, ‘He could not tell what
to do without a book to read—he should wander about without
knowing what to do with himself.’ So have I wandered about, till
now, and, waking from the dream of books at last, don’t know what
to do with myself. My poor little fellow! may’st thou dream long
amidst thy darling books, and never wake!</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>XLII. Political truth is a libel; religious truth, blasphemy.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLIII. The greatest crime in the eye of the world is to
endeavour to instruct or amend it.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLIV. Weighing remote consequences in the mind is like
weighing the air in scales.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLV. A hypocrite seems to be the only perfect character—since
it embraces the extremes of what human nature <em>is</em>, and of what it
<em>would be thought</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLVI. The Scotch understanding differs from the English, as an
Encyclopedia does from a circulating library. An Englishman is
contented to pick up a few odds and ends of knowledge; a Scotchman
is master of every subject alike. Here each individual has a particular
<em>hobby</em> and favourite bye-path of his own: in Scotland learning
is a common hack, which every one figures away with, and uses at
his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLVII. A misanthropic writer might be called <em>the Devil’s
amanuensis</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLVIII. To be a lord, a papist, and poor, is the most enviable
distinction of humanity. There is all the pride and sense of independence,
irritated and strengthened by being proscribed by power,
and liable to be harassed by petty daily insults from every, the
meanest vassal. What a situation to make the mind recoil from the
world upon itself, and to sit and brood in moody grandeur and disdain
of soul over fallen splendours and present indignities! It is just the
life I should like to have led.</p>

<p class='c006'>XLIX. The tone of good company is marked by the absence of
personalities. Among well-informed persons, there are plenty of
topics to discuss, without giving pain to any one present—without
submitting to act the part of a <em>butt</em>, or of that still poorer creature,
the wag that plays upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>L. Londoners complain of the dullness of the country, and country people
feel equally uncomfortable and at a loss what to do with
themselves in town. The fault is neither in the town nor in the
country—every one is naturally unsettled and dissatisfied without his
usual resources and occupations, let them be <em>what</em> or <em>where</em> they may.</p>

<p class='c006'>LI. Each rank in society despises that which is a step below it,
and the highest looks down upon them all. To get rid of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>impertinence of artificial pretensions, we resort to nature at last.
Kings, for this reason, are fond of low company; and lords marry
actresses and barmaids. The Duke of York (not the present, but
the late King’s brother) was at a ball at Plymouth. He danced
with a Miss Byron, a very pretty girl, daughter of the admiral of
that name, and aunt to our poet. But there was a Mrs. Fanning
present, who was a paragon of beauty. The Duke asked, ‘Who is
she?’ ‘A baker’s daughter,’ was the answer. ‘I don’t mean that;
but what is she now?’—‘A broker’s wife.’ The lady did not
perceive, that to a prince of the blood there was little difference
between a tradesman’s wife and the daughter of a naval officer; but
that the handsomest woman at a ball was an object of admiration in
spite of circumstances.</p>

<p class='c006'>LII. It has been asked, whether Lord Byron is a writer likely to
live? Perhaps not: he has intensity of power, but wants distinctive
character. In my opinion, Mr. Wordsworth is the only poet of the
present day that is likely to live—<em>should he ever happen to be born</em>!
But who will be the midwife to bring his works to light? It is a
question whether Milton would have become popular without the
help of Addison; nay, it is a question whether he is so, even with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>LIII. An anecdote is told of General Wolfe,<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c009'><sup>[66]</sup></a> that he was out
with a party of friends in a boat the day before the Battle of Quebec.
It was a beautiful summer’s evening, and the conversation turned to
Gray’s <cite>Elegy in a Country Churchyard</cite>, which was just then published.
Wolfe repeated the lines, ‘For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,’
&#38;c., with enthusiasm, and said, ‘I would rather be the author of
those lines than beat the French to-morrow!’ He did beat the
French, and was himself killed the next day. Perhaps it was better
to be capable of uttering a sentiment like this, than to gain a battle or
write a poem.</p>

<p class='c006'>LIV. Authors, a short time since, set upon Government: Government
have of late turned the tables on them, and set upon authors.
In one respect, it must be confessed, the court-tools have greatly the
advantage of us: they can go all lengths in vulgar Billingsgate and
abuse, without being charged with vulgarity. They have the sanction
of the Court; they plead the King’s privilege. It is not to be
supposed that any thing inelegant or gross can be patronised at Carlton-house.
Every thing about a place, even the convenience of an
Admiralty secretary, must, one would think, be kept sweet and
wholesome. But instead of the least refinement and polish, they treat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>us with nothing, but garbage. A lie and a nickname are their
favourite figures of rhetoric—the alternate substitutes for wit and
argument—the twin-supporters of the Bible and the Crown. They
use us (it seems) contrary to the advice of Hamlet, ‘according to
our own deserts, and not their own dignity.’ The dirt they fling
sticks on their opponents, without soiling their own fingers. Loyalty
is ‘the true fuller’s earth that takes out all stains.’ At all events, do
or say what they can, it is they who are the <em>gentlemen</em>, and we who
are the <em>blackguards</em>. If we were to call Sir Walter Scott a <em>Sawney</em>
writer, or Mr. Croker <em>Jackey</em>, it would be thought shocking, indecent,
vulgar, and no one would look at our publication twice: yet on the
Tory side the same thing passes for the height of sense and wit; and
ladies of quality are delighted with the <cite>John Bull</cite>, gentlemen read
<cite>Blackwood</cite>, and divines take in the <cite>Quarterly</cite>. There is Mr.
William Mudford, of the <cite>Courier</cite>—a vapid common-place hack, pert
and dull—but who would think of calling him by the diminutive of
his Christian name? No; these are the extreme resources reserved
for the Court-classics, who, in the zeal of their loyalty, are allowed to
forget their manners. There is, in fact, nothing too mean for the
genius of these writers, or too low for the taste of their employers.</p>

<p class='c006'>LV. A Tory can rise no higher than <em>the assumption of a question</em>.
If he relied on any thing but custom and authority, he would cease to
be a Tory. He has a prejudice in favour of certain <em>things</em>, and
against certain <em>persons</em>. This is all he knows of the matter. He
therefore gives you assertions for argument, and abuse for wit. If
you ask a reason for his opinions, he calls you names; and if you ask
why he does so, he proves that he is in the right, by repeating them
a thousand times. A nickname with him is the test of truth. It
vents his spleen, strengthens his own prejudices, and communicates
them mechanically to his hearers.</p>

<p class='c006'>LVI. When an Elector of Hanover is made into a King of
England, what does he become in the course of a century?—A
George the Fourth.</p>

<p class='c006'>LVII. If I were to give a toast at a loyal and patriotic meeting,
it should be, <em>Down with the Stuarts all over the world!</em></p>

<p class='c006'>LVIII. The taste of the great in pictures is singular, but not
unaccountable. The King is said to prefer the Dutch to the Italian
school of painting; and if you hint your surprise at this, you are
looked upon as a very Gothic and <i><span lang="fr">outré</span></i> sort of person. You are
told, however, by way of consolation, ‘To be sure, there is Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>Carlisle likes an Italian picture—Mr. Holwell Carr likes an Italian
picture—the Marquis of Stafford is fond of an Italian picture—Sir
George Beaumont likes an Italian picture.’ These, notwithstanding,
are regarded as quaint and daring exceptions to the established rule;
and their preference is a species of <i><span lang="fr">lèse-majesté</span></i> in the Fine Arts—as
great an eccentricity and want of fashionable etiquette, as if any
gentleman or nobleman still preferred old claret to new, when the
King is known to have changed his mind on this subject, or was
guilty of the offence of dipping his fore-finger and thumb in the
middle of a snuff-box, instead of gradually approximating the contents
to the edge of the box, according to the most approved models. One
would imagine that the great and exalted in station would like lofty
subjects in works of art, whereas they seem to have an exclusive
predilection for the mean and mechanical. One would think those
whose word is law, would be pleased with the great and striking
effects of the pencil<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c009'><sup>[67]</sup></a>: on the contrary, they admire nothing but the
little and elaborate. They have a fondness for cabinet or <em>furniture</em>
pictures, and a proportionable antipathy to works of genius. Even
arts with them must be servile, to be tolerated. Perhaps the seeming
contradiction may be thus explained. These persons are raised so
high above the rest of the species, that the more violent and agitating
pursuits of mankind appear to them like the turmoil of ants on a
molehill. Nothing interests them but their own pride and self-importance.
Our passions are to them an impertinence; an expression
of high sentiment they rather shrink from as a ludicrous and upstart
assumption of equality. They, therefore, like what glitters to the
eye, what is smooth to the touch; but they shun, by an instinct of
sovereign taste, whatever has a soul in it, and implies a <em>reciprocity</em> of
feeling. The gods of the earth can have no interest in any thing
human; they are cut off from all sympathy with the ‘bosoms and
businesses of men.’ Instead of requiring to be wound up beyond
their habitual feeling of stately dignity, they wished to have the springs
of overstrained pretension let down, to be relaxed with ‘trifles light
as air,’ to be amused with the familiar and frivolous, and to have the
world appear a scene of <em>still life</em>, except as they disturb it! The
little in thought and internal sentiment is a necessary relief and set-off
to the oppressive sense of external magnificence. Hence Kings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>babble and repeat they know not what. A childish dotage often
accompanies the consciousness of absolute power. Repose is somewhere
necessary, and the soul sleeps, while the senses gloat around.
Besides, the mechanical and high-finished style of art may be considered
as something <em>done to order</em>. It is a task to be executed more
or less perfectly, according to the price given and the industry of the
artist. We stand by, as it were, see the work done, insist upon a
greater degree of neatness and accuracy, and exercise a sort of petty
jealous jurisdiction over each particular. We are judges of the
minuteness of the details, and though ever so nicely executed, as they
give us no ideas beyond what we had before, we do not feel humbled
in the comparison. The artisan scarcely rises into the artist; and
the name of genius is degraded, rather than exalted in his person.
The performance is so far ours that we have paid for it, and the
highest price is all that is necessary to produce the highest finishing.
But it is not so in works of genius and imagination. Their price is
above rubies. The inspiration of the Muse comes not with the <i><span lang="la">fiat</span></i>
of a monarch, with the donation of a patron; and therefore the Great
turn with disgust or effeminate indifference from the mighty masters
of the Italian school because such works baffle and confound their
self-will, and make them feel that there is something in the mind of
man which they can neither give nor take away.</p>

<p class='c006'>LIX. The style of conversation in request in courts proceeds
much upon the same principle. It is low, and it is little. I have
known a few persons who have had access to the Presence (and who
might be supposed to catch what they could of the tone of royalty at
second-hand, bating the dignity—God knows there was nothing of
that!) and I should say they were the <em>highest finishers</em> in this respect
I ever met with. No circumstance escaped them, they worked out
all the details (whether to the purpose or not) like a fac-simile, they
mimicked every thing, explained every thing; the story was not <em>told</em>,
but acted over again. It is true, there were no <i><span lang="fr">grandes pensées</span></i>, there
was a complete truce with all thought and reflection; but they were
everlasting dealers in matters of fact, and there was no end of their
minute prolixity—one must suppose this mode pleased their betters,
or was copied from them. Dogberry’s declaration—‘Were I as
tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all upon your
worship’—is not so much a blunder of the clown’s, as a sarcasm of the
poet’s. Are we to account for the effect (as before) from supposing
that their overstrained attention to great things makes them seek for a
change in little ones?—Or that their idea of themselves as raised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>above every one else is confirmed by dwelling on the meanest and most
insignificant objects?—Or is it that from their ignorance and seclusion
from the world, every thing is alike new and wonderful to them? Or
that dreading the insincerity of those about them, they exact an
extraordinary degree of trifling accuracy, and require every one to
tell a story, as if he was giving evidence on oath before a court of
justice? West said that the late King used to get him up into a
corner, and fairly put his hands before him so that he could not get
away, till he had got every particular out of him relating to the affairs
of the Royal Academy. This weakness in the mind of kings has
been well insisted on by Peter Pindar. It is of course like one of
the spots in the sun.</p>

<p class='c006'>LX. I hate to be near the sea, and to hear it roaring and raging
like a wild beast in its den. It puts me in mind of the everlasting
efforts of the human mind, struggling to be free, and ending just where
it began.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXI. Happy are they that can say with Timon—‘I am Misanthropos,
and hate mankind!’ They can never be at a loss for
subjects to exercise their spleen upon: their sources of satisfaction
must hold out while the world stands. Those who do not pity
others, assuredly need not envy them: if they take pleasure in the
distresses of their fellow-creatures, they have their wish. Let them
cast an eye on that long disease, human life, on that villainous
compound, human nature, and glut their malice. There is madness,
there is idiotcy, there is sickness, old age, and death; there is the
cripple, the blind, and the deaf; there is the deformed in body, the
weak in mind, the prisoner and the gaoler, the beggar and the dwarf;
there is poverty, labour, pain, ignominy; there is riches, pride, griping
avarice, bloated luxury; there is the agony of suffering or the
lassitude of <i><span lang="fr">ennui</span></i>; there is the sickness of the heart from hope
delayed, and the worse and more intolerable sickness from hope
attained; there is the gout, the stone, the plague, cold, fever, thirst,
and nakedness, shipwreck, famine, fire and the sword, all are instruments
of human fate, and pamper the dignity of human nature: there
are the racking pains of jealousy, remorse, and anguish, the lingering
ones of disappointment, sorrow, and regret; there is the consciousness
of unmerited, hopeless obscurity, and ‘the cruel sunshine thrown by
fortune on a fool;’ there is unrequited love, and—marriage; there is
the coquet slighting others and slighted in her turn, the jilt, the antiquated
prude, the brutal husband, and the common-place wife; there
are vows of celibacy and lost character; there is the cabal, the idle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>gossiping, the churlishness and dulness of the country, the heartlessness
and profligacy of great cities; there are the listless days, the
sleepless nights, the having too much or too little to do; years spent
in vain in a pursuit, or, if successful, the having to leave it at last;
there are the jealousies of different professions among themselves or
of each other, lawyers, divines, physicians, artists; the contempt of
the more thriving for the less fortunate, and the hatred and heart-burnings
with which it is repaid; there is hypocrisy, oppression,
falsehood, treachery, cowardice, selfishness, meanness; the luck of
fools, the respectability of knaves; the cant of piety, loyalty, and
humanity; the lamentations of West-India planters over the ingratitude
of their negro slaves, and Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> resigning to God and the
Mother of all Saints the credit of the success of his arms; there are
sects and parties, kings and their subjects, queens and common-council
men, speeches in Parliament, plays and actors <em>damned</em>, or successful
for a time and then laid on the shelf, and heard of no more; quacks
at all corners, mountebanks in the pulpit, and drones in the state,
peace and war, treaties of offence and defence, conspiracies, revolutions,
Holy Alliances, the sudden death of Lord Castlereagh, and
the oratory of his successor Mr. Canning, hid for the present like the
moon ‘in its vacant interlunar cave;’ and Ferdinand and his paper-kites,
and the Cortes, unconscious of the rebel maxim, ‘Catch a king
and kill a king’; and Slop raving at the bloodthirsty victims of
courtly assassins, and whetting mild daggers for patriot throats; and
Mr. Croker’s <em>cheat-the-gallows face</em> in the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, and Lord
Wellington’s <em>heart</em> in the cause of Spanish liberty, and a beloved
Monarch retired amid all this to shady solitude ‘to play with
Wisdom.’ A good hater may here find wherewithal to feed the
largest spleen and swell it, even to bursting!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXII. Happiness, like mocking, is catching. At least, none but
those who are happy in themselves, can make others so. No wit, no
understanding, neither riches nor beauty, can communicate this feeling—the
happy alone can make happy. Love and Joy are twins, or
born of each other.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXIII. No one knows when he is safe from ridicule.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXIV. Is it a misfortune or a happiness that we so often like the
faults of one we love better than the virtues of any other woman;
that we like her refusals, better than all other favours; that we like
her love of others, better than any one else’s love of us?</p>

<p class='c006'>LXV. If a man were refused by a woman a thousand times, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>he really loved her, he would still think that at the bottom of her
heart she preferred him to every one else. Nor is this wonderful,
when we consider that all passion is a species of madness; and that
the feeling in the mind towards the beloved object is the most
amiable and delightful thing in the world. Our love to her is
heavenly, and so (the heart whispers us) must hers be to us—though
it were buried at the bottom of the sea; nay, from the tomb our
self-love would revive it! We never can persuade ourselves that
a mistress cares nothing about us, till we no longer care about her.
No! It is certain that there is nothing truly deserving of love but
love, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In spite of pride, in erring reason’s spite,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>we still believe in the justice of the blind God!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXVI. It would be easy to forget a misplaced attachment, but
that we do not like to acknowledge ourselves in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXVII. A great mind is one that can forget or look beyond itself.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXVIII. The grand scenes of Nature are more adapted for
occasional visits than for constant residence. They are the temples
of the Goddess, not fit dwellings for her worshippers. Familiarity
breeds contempt or indifference; and it is better to connect this
feeling with the petty and trivial than with the lofty and sublime.
Besides, it is unnecessary to run the risk in the latter case. One chief
advantage of the great and magnificent objects of Nature is, that they
stamp their image on the mind for ever; the blow need not be repeated
to have the desired effect. We take them with us wherever we go;
we have but to think of them and they appear; and at the distance
of half a life or of the circumference of the globe, we unlock the
springs of memory, and the tall mountain shoots into the sky, the lake
expands its bosom, and the cataract rushes from the pine-clad rock.
The bold majestic outline is all that there is to discover in such situations,
and this we can always remember. In more cultivated and
artificial scenes we may observe a thousand hedge-row beauties with
curious eye, or pluck the tender flower beneath our feet, while Skiddaw
hovers round our heads, and the echoes of Helvellyn thunder in our
hearts.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXIX. I should always choose to live within reach of a fine
prospect, rather than to see one from my windows. A number of
romantic, distant objects staring in upon one (uncalled-for) tantalise
the imagination, and tempt the truant feet; whereas, at home, I wish
to feel satisfied where I am, and sheltered from the world.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>LXX. Mr. Martin’s picture of Adam and Eve in Paradise has
this capital defect, that there is no <em>repose</em> in it. You see two insignificant
naked figures, and a preposterous architectural landscape, like a
range of buildings overlooking them. They might as well be represented
sleeping on the top of the pinnacle of the Temple with the
world and all the glories thereof spread out before them. They
ought to have been painted imparadised in one another’s arms,
shut up in measureless content, with Eden’s choicest bowers closing
round them, and Nature stooping to clothe them with vernal bowers.
Nothing could be too retired, too voluptuous, too sacred from day’s
garish eye: instead of which, you have a gaudy panoramic view,
a glittering barren waste, a triple row of clouds, of rocks, and
mountains piled one upon the other, as if the imagination already
bent its idle gaze over that wide world, which was so soon to be their
place of exile, and the aching restless spirit of the artist was occupied
in building a stately prison for our first parents, instead of decking
their bridal bed, and wrapping them in a short-lived dream of bliss!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXI. The mind tires of variety, but becomes reconciled to
uniformity. Change produces a restless habit, a love of farther
change: the recurrence of the same objects conduces to repose, and
to content. My Uncle Toby’s bowling-green bounded his harmless
ambition; Bonaparte, not contented with France and Europe for a
pleasure-ground, wanted to have Russia for an ice-house; and
Alexander, at the farthest side of India, wept for new worlds to
conquer. If we let our thoughts wander abroad, there is no end to
fantastic projects, to the craving after novelty, to fickleness, and
disappointment: if we confine them at home, Peace may find them
there. Mr. Horne Tooke used to contend that all tendency to excess
was voluntary in the mind: the wants of Nature kept within a certain
limit. Even if a person adhered to a regular number of cups of tea
or glasses of wine, he did not feel tempted to exceed this number:
but if he once went beyond his usual allowance, the desire to transgress
increased with its indulgence, and the artificial appetite was proportioned
to the artificial stimulus. It has been remarked that in the
tropical climates, where there is no difference of seasons, time passes
away on smoother and swifter pinions, ‘the earth spins round on its soft
axle,’ unnoticed, unregretted: and life wears out soonest and best in
sequestered privacy, within the round of a few, simple, unenvied
enjoyments.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXII. The retailing of a set of anecdotes is not conversation.
A story admits of no answer: a remark or an opinion naturally calls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>forth another, and leads to as many different views of a subject as
there are minds in company. An officer in a Scotch marching
regiment has always a number of very edifying anecdotes to communicate:
but unless you are of the same mess or the same clan, you are
necessarily <em>sent to Coventry</em>. Prosing, mechanical narrations of this
kind are tedious, as well as tinctured with egotism: if they are set
off with a brilliant manner, with mimicry, and action, they become
theatrical: the speaker is a kind of <em>Mr. Matthews at home</em>, and the
audience are more or less delighted and amused with the exhibition;
but there is an end of society, and you no more think of interrupting
a confirmed story-teller, than you would of interrupting a favourite
actor on the stage.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXIII. The Queen’s trial gave a deathblow to the hopes of all
reflecting persons with respect to the springs and issues of public spirit
and opinion. It was the only question I ever knew that excited a
thorough popular feeling. It struck its roots into the heart of the
nation; it took possession of every house or cottage in the kingdom;
man, woman, and child took part in it, as if it had been their own
concern. Business was laid aside for it: people forgot their pleasures,
even their meals were neglected, nothing was thought of but the fate
of the Queen’s trial. The arrival of the <cite>Times Newspaper</cite> was looked
upon as an event in every village, the Mails hardly travelled fast
enough; and he who had the latest intelligence in his pocket was
considered as the happiest of mortals. It kept the town in a ferment
for several weeks: it agitated the country to the remotest corner. It
spread like wildfire over the kingdom; the public mind was electrical.
So it should be on other occasions; it was only so on this. An
individual may be oppressed, a nation may be trampled upon, mankind
may be threatened with annihilation of their rights, and the threat
enforced; and not a finger is raised, not a heart sinks, not a pulse
beats quicker in the public or private quarrel, a momentary burst of
vain indignation is heard, dies away, and is forgotten. Truth has no
echo, but folly and imposture have a thousand reverberations in the
hollowness of the human heart. At the very time when all England
went mad about the poor Queen, a man of the name of Bruce was
sent to Botany Bay for having spoken to another who was convicted
of sedition; and no notice was taken of it. We have seen what has
been done in Spain, and Earth does not roll its billows over the heads
of tyrants, to bury them in a common grave. What was it then in
the Queen’s cause that stirred this mighty ‘coil and pudder’ in the
breast? Was it the love of truth, of justice, of liberty? No such
thing! Her case was at best doubtful, and she had only suffered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>loss of privileges peculiar to herself. But she was a Queen, she was
a woman, and <em>a thorn in the King’s side</em>. There was the cant of
loyalty, the cant of gallantry, and the cant of freedom mixed altogether
in delightful and inextricable confusion. She was a Queen—all the
loyal and well-bred bowed to the name; she was a wife—all the
women took the alarm; she was at variance with the lawful sovereign—all
the free and independent Electors of Westminster and London
were up in arms. ‘The Queen’s name was a tower of strength,’
which these persons had hitherto wanted, and were glad to catch at.
Though a daughter of the Duke of Brunswick, though a grand-daughter
of George <span class='fss'>III.</span>, yet because she was separated from her
husband, she must be hand-and-glove with the people, the wretched,
helpless, doating, credulous, meddlesome people, who are always
ready to lick the hands, not just then raised to shed their blood or
rivet on their chains. There was here an idol to pull down and an
idol to set up. There was an imperial title and meretricious frontispiece
to the spurious volume of Liberty. There was the mock-majesty
of an empty throne behind the real one, and the impertinence
of mankind was interested to thrust the unwelcome claimant into it.
City patriots stood a chance of becoming liege men, and true to
a Queen—of their own choosing. The spirit of faction was half
merged in the spirit of servility. There was a rag-fair of royalty—every
one carried his own paints and patches into the presence of the
new Lady of Loretto—there was a sense of homage due, of services
and countenance bestowed on Majesty. This popular farce had all
the charm of <em>private theatricals</em>. The Court of St. James’s was
nothing to the <em>make-believe</em> Court at Kew. The king was a sort of
<em>state-fixture</em>; but the Queen-Consort, the favourite of the rabble, was
herself one of them. The presence-doors were flung open, and every
blackguard and blockhead rushed in. What an opportunity to see,
to hear, to touch a Queen! To gratify the itch of loyalty by coming
in contact with the person of the Sovereign was a privilege reserved
for a few; but to receive this favour at the Queen’s hands was a distinction
common to all. All the trades of London came to kiss the
Queen’s hand: Presbyterian parsons knelt to kiss the hand of their
royal mistress; the daughters of country curates and of city knights
sipped loyalty from the back of her Majesty’s hand. Radicals and
reformers contended who should be first in paying homage to the
Queen; there was a race for precedence, quarrelling and pulling of
caps between the wives of distinguished orators and caricaturists, at
the very footsteps of the throne; while Mr. Alderman Wood,</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>strove to keep the peace, and vindicate the character of civic dames
for courtly manners. Mr. Place, Mr. Hone, Mr. Thelwall, Sir
Richard Phillips, kissed her Majesty’s hand; Mr. Cobbett alone was
not invited,—it was thought he might <em>bite</em>. What a pity that it was
before Mr. Irving’s time, or he might have thrown in the casting-weight
of his perfect mind and body, and <em>ousted</em> both the King and
Bergami! In the midst of all this, his Majesty went to the play,
bowed to the boxes, the pit, the gallery, and to the <em>actors</em>, and you
would suppose in four days’ time, that a whisper had never been uttered
to imply that the King not only was not the most graceful man in his
dominions, but the best of monarchs and of husbands. The Queen
and her <em>pic-nic</em> parties were no more thought of. What a scene for
history to laugh at!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXIV. A crowd was collected under the Horse-Guards, and
on enquiry I found it was to see the Duke of York come out. ‘What
went they forth for to see?’ They were some of the lowest and
most wretched of the people, and it was perhaps the sense of contrast,—a
sense of which the great and mighty have always availed themselves
liberally, to cherish the enthusiasm of their admirers. It was
also curiosity to see a name, a sound that they had so often heard,
reduced to an object of sight; a metaphysical and political abstraction
actually coming out of a door with a ruddy face and a frock-coat. It
was, in the first place, the Commander-in-Chief, and the commander
of the troops at Dunkirk, the author of the love-letters to Mrs. Clarke
and of army-circulars, the son of the King, and presumptive heir to
the Crown;—there were all these contradictions embodied in the same
person. ‘Oh, the wonderful works of nature,’ as the <em>Recruit</em> in the
play says on looking at the guinea which has just enlisted him: so
we may say on looking at a king or a king’s brother. I once pointed
out the Duke of York to a Scotchman. ‘Is that his Grace—I mean
his Royal Highness?’ said the native of the North, out of breath to
acknowledge the title, and pay with his tongue the instinctive adulation
which his heart felt!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXV. When Effie Deans becomes a fine lady, do we not look
back with regret to the time when she was the poor faded lily of St.
Leonards, the outcast and condemned prisoner? So, should the
cause of liberty and mankind ever become triumphant, instead of
militant, may we not heave a sigh of regret over the past, and think
that poor suffering human nature, with all its wrongs and insults,
trodden into the earth like a vile weed, was a more interesting topic
for reflection? We need not be much alarmed for the event, even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>if this should be so; for the way to Utopia is not ‘the primrose
path of dalliance;’ and at the rate we have hitherto gone on, it must
be many thousand years off!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXVI. Mankind are an incorrigible race. Give them but
bugbears and idols—it is all that they ask; the distinctions of right
and wrong, of truth and falsehood, of good and evil, are worse than
indifferent to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXVII. The Devil was a great loss in the preternatural world.
He was always something to fear and to hate. He supplied the
antagonist powers of the imagination, and the arch of true religion
hardly stands firm without him. Mr. Irving may perhaps bring him
into fashion again.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXVIII. Perhaps the evils arising from excessive inequality in
a state would be sufficiently obviated if property were divided equally
among the surviving children. But it is said it would be impossible
to make a law for this purpose, under any circumstances or with any
qualifications, because the least interference with the disposal of property
would be striking at its existence and at the very root of all
property. And yet this objection is urged in those very countries,
where the law of primogeniture (intended to keep it in disproportionate
masses, and setting aside the will of the testator altogether)
is established as an essential part of the law of the land. So blind is
reason, where passion or prejudice intervenes!</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXIX. Kings, who set up for Gods upon earth, should be
treated as madmen, which one half of them, or as idiots, which the
other half, really are.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXX. Tyrants are at all times mad with the lust of power.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXXI. Reformers are naturally speculative people; and speculative
people are effeminate and inactive. They brood over ideas,
till realities become almost indifferent to them. They talk when
they should act, and are distracted with nice doubts and distinctions,
while the enemy is thundering at the gates, and the bomb-shells are
bursting at their feet. They hold up a paper Constitution as their
shield, which the sword pierces through, and drinks their heart’s
blood! They are cowards, too, at bottom; and dare not strike a
decisive blow, lest it should be retaliated. While they merely prate
of moderation and the public good, they think, if the worst comes to
the worst, there may still be a chance of retreat for them, hoping to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>screen themselves behind their imbecility. They are not like their
opponents, whose all is at stake, and who are urged on by instinctive
fury and habitual cunning to defend it: the common good is too
remote a speculation to call forth any violent passions or personal
sacrifices; and if it should be lost, it is as fine a topic as ever to
harangue and lament about. Patriots are, by the constitution of their
minds, poets; and an Elegy on the fall of Liberty is as interesting to
hear or to recite as an Ode on its most triumphant success. They
who let off Ferdinand the other day, confiding in the promises of a
traitor and in the liberality of a despot, were greater hypocrites to
themselves than he was.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXXII. In the late quarrel about Liberty, upwards of five
millions of men have been killed, and <em>one king</em>.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXXIII. The people (properly speaking) are not a herd of
slaves just let loose, or else goaded on, like blind drudges, to execute
the behests of their besotted taskmasters; but the band of free
citizens, taught to know their rights, and prepared to exercise them.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXXIV. The people are the slaves of ignorance and custom;
the friends of the people are the dupes of reason and humanity.
Power stops at nothing but its own purposes.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXXV. The Author of Waverley observes—‘In truth, the
Scottish peasantry are still infected with that rage for funeral ceremonial,
which once distinguished the grandees of the kingdom so
much, that a sumptuary law was made by the Parliament of Scotland
for the purpose of restraining it; and I have known many in the
lowest stations who have denied themselves not merely the comforts,
but almost the necessaries of life, in order to save such a sum of
money as might enable their surviving friends to bury them like
Christians, as they termed it; nor could their faithful executors be
prevailed upon, though equally necessitous, to turn to the use and
maintenance of the living the money vainly wasted upon the interment
of the dead.’—‘Antiquary,’ vol. IV. p. 48. If I were to
attempt an explanation of the peculiar delight and pride which the
Scotch are thus supposed to take in funeral ceremonies, I should say,
that as inhabitants of wild and barren districts, they are more familiar
with the face of nature than with the face of man; and easily turn to
it as their place of rest and final home. There is little difference, in
their imaginations, between treading the green mountain turf, and
being laid beneath it. The world itself is but a living tomb to them.
Their mode of subsistence is cold, hard, comfortless, bare of luxuries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>and of enjoyments, torpid, inured to privations and self-denial; and
death seems to be its consummation and triumph, rather than its unwelcome
end. Their life was a sort of struggle for a dreary
existence; so that it relapses into the grave with joy and a feeling
of exultation. The grey rock out of which their tomb is cut is a
citadel against all assaults of the flesh and the spirit; the kindred
earth that wraps the weather-beaten, worn-out body, is a soft and
warm resting-place from the hardships it has had to encounter. It is
no wonder, therefore, that the Scotch prepare for the due celebration
of this event with the foresight characteristic of them, and that their
friends consign them to the earth with becoming fortitude and costly
ceremony. ‘Man,’ says Sir Thomas Brown, though in quite a
different spirit, ‘man is a noble animal, splendid in ashes and pompous
in the grave; solemnising nativities and deaths with equal lustre, nor
omitting ceremonies of bravery, even in the <span class='fss'>INFAMY</span> of his nature.—<cite>See
his</cite> <span class='fss'>URN BURIAL</span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>LXXXVI. In the Heart of Midlothian vol. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 13, we meet
with the following reflections: ‘Perhaps one ought to be actually a
Scotchman to conceive how ardently, under all distinctions of rank
and situation, they feel their mutual connection with each other as
natives of the same country. There are, I believe, more associations
common to the inhabitants of a rude and wild than of a well-cultivated
and fertile country: their ancestors have more seldom changed their
place of residence; their mutual recollection of remarkable objects is
more accurate; the high and the low are more interested in each
other’s welfare; the feelings of kindred and relationship are more
widely extended; and, in a word, the bonds of patriotic affection,
always honourable, even when a little too exclusively strained, have
more influence on men’s feelings and actions.’ Thus far our author,
but without making much progress in the question he has started.
‘<em>Via</em> Goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while’—I
might say, but I do not choose, to say so, to the Great Unknown.
There is an enumeration of particulars, slightly and collaterally connected
with the subject, but, as ‘Douce David Deans’ would say,
‘they do not touch the root of the matter.’ In fact, then, the mind
more easily forms a strong and abstracted attachment to the soil (in
which it was bred) in remote and barren regions, where few artificial
objects or pursuits fritter away attention, or divert it from its devotion
to the naked charms of nature—(perhaps the privations, dangers, and
loneliness incident to such situations also enhance the value and
deepen the interest we take in them)—and again, in a rude and
scattered population, where there is a dearth and craving after general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>society, we naturally become more closely and permanently attached
to those few persons with whom neighbourhood, or kindred, or a
common cause, or similar habits or language, bring us into contact.
Two Englishmen meeting in the wilds of Arabia would instantly
become friends, though they had never seen one another before, from
the want of all other society and sympathy. So it is in the ruder
and earlier stages of civilisation. This is what attaches the Highlander
to his hill and to his clan. This is what attaches Scotchmen
to their country and to one another. A Londoner, in his fondness
for London, is distracted between the play-houses, the opera, the
shops, the coffee-houses, the crowded streets, &#38;c. An inhabitant of
Edinburgh has none of these diversities to reconcile: he has but one
idea in his head or in his mouth,—that of the Calton Hill; an idea
which is easily embraced, and which he never quits his hold of,
till something more substantial offers,—a situation as porter in a warehouse,
or as pimp to a great man.</p>

on the Principles of Human Action</cite>. See Bibliographical Note, vol. <span class='fss'>VII.</span> p. 384.
The source of the essay does not appear to be known, but it very likely formed
the substance of one of the Lectures which Hazlitt delivered at the Russell Institution.
See <i><span lang="la">ante</span></i>, pp. 25, <i><span lang="la">et seq.</span></i> and notes. The title of one of these Lectures (<span class='fss'>III.</span>)
was ‘On Berkeley’s Principles of Human Knowledge, and on the Nature of
Abstraction.’ It has not been thought necessary to give references to all the
numerous passages quoted from Locke and other philosophers discussed by Hazlitt.
In many cases he himself gives a sufficient reference in the text.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>ON THE WRITINGS OF HOBBES</h3>

<p class='c023'>This and the four succeeding papers were first published in <cite>Literary Remains</cite>,
where the author’s son says of them (vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 115): ‘The following Essays
form part of a series of Lectures delivered with very great effect by my father
at the Russell Institution, in 1813. I found them with other papers in an old
hamper which many years ago he stuffed confusedly full of <span class='fss'>MSS.</span> and odd volumes
of books, and left in the <em>care</em> of some lodging-house people, by whom it was
thrown into a cellar, so damp that even the covers of some of the books were
fast mouldering when I first looked over the collection. The injury to the
<span class='fss'>MSS.</span> may be imagined. Some of the Lectures, indeed, to my deep regret, are
altogether missing, burnt, probably, by the ignorant people of the house; and I
have had the greatest difficulty in preparing those which remain for the press.
They are, however, most valuable.’ The course, consisting of ten Lectures, was
delivered in 1812, not 1813. The syllabus will be found in Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span><cite>Memoirs of William Hazlitt</cite>, 1. 192 et seq. The first lecture was ‘On the Writings
of Hobbes, showing that he was the father of the modern system of philosophy.’</p>

<h3 class='c022'>MADAME DE STAËL’S ACCOUNT OF GERMAN PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE</h3>

<p class='c023'>Madame de Staël’s <cite>De l’Allemagne</cite>, published in London in 1813, had been
reviewed, possibly by Hazlitt, in <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> for Nov. 13, 1813, and the
four papers here reprinted and signed ‘An English Metaphysician’ are ostensibly a
continuation of that review, though they contain very little about German
philosophy and nothing at all about German literature. They are, in fact, merely
fragments in letter form of the course of lectures which Hazlitt had recently
delivered at the Russell Institution. See <i><span lang="la">ante</span></i>, pp. 25 <i><span lang="la">et seq.</span></i> and notes. Hazlitt
was a regular contributor to <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> during 1813 and 1814. Some
of his contributions on politics, the stage, and the fine arts will be found in vols.
<span class='fss'>III.</span>, <span class='fss'>VIII.</span> and <span class='fss'>IX.</span> of the present edition; and he gives an account of his relations
with James Perry, the editor, in the essay ‘On Patronage and Puffing’ (see vol. <span class='fss'>VI.</span>
p. 289). None of the <cite>Chronicle</cite> papers included in the present volume have been

afterwards partly republished with omissions and variations in two essays in <cite>The
Round Table</cite>. See vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> pp. 111–125. These omissions and variations are given
below.</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>At the beginning of the first essay as published in <cite>The Round Table</cite> add from 
    the first (August 21, 1814) of <cite>The Examiner</cite> articles the following passage:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘In power of intellect, in lofty conception, in the depth of feeling, at once simple and 
    sublime, which pervades every part of it and which gives to every object an almost 
    preternatural and preterhuman interest, this work has seldom been surpassed. If the 
    subject of the Poem had been equal to the genius of the Poet, if the skill with which he 
    has chosen his materials had accorded with the power exerted over them, if the objects 
    (whether persons or things) which he makes use of as the vehicle of his feelings had been 
    such as immediately and irresistibly to convey them in all their force and depth to 
    others, then the production before us would indeed have “proved a monument,” as he 
    himself wishes it, worthy of the author and of his country. Whether, as it is, this most 
    original and powerful performance may not rather remain like one of those stupendous but 
    half-finished structures, which have been suffered to moulder into decay, because the 
    cost and labour attending them exceeded their use or beauty, we feel it would be rather 
    presumptuous in us to determine.’
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>At the end of the first paragraph on p. 112 add the following note:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘Every one wishes to get rid of the booths and bridges in the Park,<a id='r68'></a><a 
    href='#f68' class='c009'><sup>[68]</sup></a> in order to have a view 
    of the ground and water again. Our Poet looks at the more lasting and serious works of 
    men as baby-houses and toys, and from the greater elevation of his mind regards them much 
    in the same light as we do the Regent’s Fair and Mr. Vansittart’s “permanent erections.”’

    have wished,’ etc. (vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 113) read:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘We could have wished that Mr. Wordsworth had given to his work <span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>the form of a 
    philosophical poem altogether, with only occasional digressions or allusions to 
    particular instances. There is in his general sentiments and reflections on human life a 
    depth, an originality, a truth, a beauty, and grandeur both of conception and expression, 
    which place him decidedly at the head of the poets of the present day, or rather which 
    place him in a totally distinct class of excellence. But he has chosen to encumber 
    himself with a load of narrative and description which, instead of assisting, hinders the 
    progress and effect of the general reasoning. Almost all this part of the work, which Mr. 
    Wordsworth has inwoven with the text, would have come in better in plain prose as notes 
    at the end. Indeed, there is something evidently inconsistent, upon his own principles, 
    in the construction of the poem. For he professes, in these ambiguous illustrations, to 
    avoid all that is striking or extraordinary—all that can raise the imagination or affect 
    the passions—all that is not every way common and necessarily included in the natural 
    workings of the passions in all minds and in all circumstances. Then why introduce 
    particular illustrations at all which add nothing to the force of the general truth, 
    which hang as a dead weight upon the imagination, which degrade the thought and weaken 
    the sentiment, and the connection of which with the general principle it is more 
    difficult to find out than to understand the general principle itself? It is only by an 
    extreme process of abstraction that it is often possible to trace the operation of the 
    general law in the particular illustration, yet it is to supply the defect of abstraction 
    that the illustration is given. Mr. Wordsworth indeed says finely, and perhaps as truly 
    as finely,’ etc.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Instead of saying that Wordsworth’s powers of description and fancy seem to be little 
    inferior to those of his classical predecessor, Akenside (p. 114), Hazlitt, in <cite>The 
    Examiner</cite>, made the very different statement that ‘his powers of description and 
    fancy seem to be little inferior to those of thought and sentiment.’
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>To the quotation on page 116, ‘Poor gentleman,’ etc. Hazlitt adds, as a note, ‘Love in a 
    Wood.’
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>After the words ‘any thing but dull’ (p. 116, l. 22) add, from <cite>The Examiner</cite>, 
    ‘<em>Rasselas</em> indeed is dull; but then it is privileged dulness.’
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>After ‘natural exercise of others’ (p. 117, l. 7) add ‘The intellectual and the moral 
    faculties of man are different; the ideas of things and the feelings of pleasure and pain 
    connected with them.’ There are a few other trifling verbal alterations in this 
    paragraph. The note on the word ‘solitary’ on p. 117 is not in <cite>The Examiner</cite>.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>A third essay on the same subject was published in <cite>The Examiner</cite> for October 
    2, 1814. This was reprinted with a few omissions and additions in <cite>The Round 
    Table</cite> (see vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> pp. 120–125).
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>The opening paragraph in <cite>The Round Table</cite> is condensed from the following:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘Poetry may be properly divided into two classes; the poetry of imagination and the 
    poetry of sentiment. The one consists in the power of calling up images of the most 
    pleasing or striking kind; the other depends on the strength of the interest which it 
    excites in given objects. The one may be said to arise out of the faculties of memory and 
    invention, conversant with the world of external nature; the other from the fund of our 
    moral sensibility. In the combination of these different excellences the perfection of 
    poetry consists; the greatest poets of our own or other countries have been equally 
    distinguished for richness of invention and depth of feeling. By the greatest poets of 
    our own country, we mean Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton, who evidently 
    possessed both kinds of <span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>imagination, the intellectual and moral, in the highest 
    degree. Young and Cowley might be cited as the most brilliant instances of the separation 
    of feeling from fancy, of men who were dazzled by the exuberance of their own thoughts 
    and whose genius was sacrificed to their want of taste. Mr. Wordsworth, on the other 
    hand, whose powers of feeling are of the highest order, is certainly deficient in 
    fanciful invention: his writings exhibit all the internal power, without the external 
    form of poetry. He has none of the pomp and decoration and scenic effect of poetry: no 
    gorgeous palaces nor solemn temples awe the imagination: no cities rise with glistering 
    spires and pinnacles adorned<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' style='text-decoration: none; 
    '><sup>[69]</sup></a>: we meet with no knights pricked forth on airy steeds: no 
    hair-breadth scapes and perilous accidents<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' 
    class='c009'><sup>[70]</sup></a> by flood or field. Either from the 
    predominant habit of his mind, not requiring the stimulus of outward impressions, or from 
    the want of an imagination teeming with various forms, he takes the common every-day 
    events and objects of nature, or rather seeks those that are the most simple and barren 
    of effect; but he adds to them a weight of interest from the resources of his own mind, 
    which makes the most insignificant things serious and even formidable. All other 
    interests are absorbed in the deeper interest of his own thoughts, and find the same 
    level. His mind magnifies the littleness of his subject, and raises its meanness; lends 
    it his strength, and clothes it with borrowed grandeur. With him a molehill, covered with 
    wild thyme, assumes the importance of “the great vision of the guarded mount”<a 
    id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c009'><sup>[71]</sup></a>: a puddle 
    is filled with preternatural faces, and agitated with the fiercest storms of passion; and

    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>The short paragraph on p. 122 reads in <cite>The Examiner</cite>:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘We think it is pushing our love or admiration of natural objects a good deal too far, to 
    make it a set-off against a story like the preceding, which carries that concentration of 
    self-interest and callousness to the feelings of others to its utmost pitch, which is the 
    general character of those who are cut off by their mountains and valleys from an 
    intercourse with mankind, even more than of the country people.’
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>In <cite>The Examiner</cite>, after the words ‘the beautiful poem of <cite>Hart Leap 
    Well</cite>,’ the essay concludes as follows:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘We conceive that about as many fine things have passed through Mr. Wordsworth’s mind as, 
    with five or six exceptions, through any human mind whatever. The conclusion of the 
    passage we refer to is admirable, and comes in like some dying close in music:—[<cite>The 
    Excursion</cite>, Book <span class='fss'>VII.</span>, ll. 976–1007].
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘If Mr. Wordsworth does not always write in this manner, it is his own fault. He can as 
    often as he pleases. It is not in our power to add to, or take away from, the pretensions 
    of a poem like the present, but if our opinion or wishes could have any weight, we would 
    take our leave of it by saying—<cite>Esto</cite> perpetua!’
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>The first two of these <cite>Examiner</cite> articles are referred to by Lamb in a

    Hazlitt, <span class='fss'>I.</span> 434–5. It is significant of Hazlitt’s increasing 
    bitterness (caused mainly, no doubt, by the final downfall of Napoleon) that the passages 
    omitted from <cite>The Round Table</cite> are for the most part of a highly eulogistic 
    character.

‘Chateaubriand, The Quack,’ which contained a casual reference to the Duke
D’Enghien, ‘whom Buonaparte is accused of having murdered because he was not
willing that he, the said Royal Duke, should assassinate him.’ ‘Fair Play’
seized on this passage and protested (September 10) against the implied defence of
the Duke D’Enghien’s execution. ‘Peter Pickthank’ replied (September 24),
and the correspondence was kept up till near the end of the year, ‘Fair Play’
contributing letters on October 1, October 29, and November 26. ‘Peter
Pickthank’s’ letters contain many of Hazlitt’s stock quotations and personal
allusions (to Dr. Stoddart, for example); they embody exactly his political
opinions, and altogether the internal evidence of their having been written by him
is very strong. Inasmuch, however, as there is not absolute certainty in the
matter, and a considerable part of the letters would have been unintelligible
without including ‘Fair Play’s’ letters as well, the editors have felt justified in
omitting the whole correspondence. An editorial note at the end of ‘Peter
Pickthank’s’ third letter (November 19) states that ‘this article has been delayed
in order to soften some of the asperities.’</p>

  <h3 class='c022'>[THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED]</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>In <cite>The Examiner</cite> for March 3, 1816 appeared the following note:—‘A
correspondent who signs himself J.W. thinks we ought to bring proofs of Mr.
Locke’s want of originality as the founder of a system. We recommend him,
if he is curious on this subject, to read the first eighty pages of Hobbes’s <cite>Leviathan</cite>,
if the name does not alarm him. After that, if he is not satisfied and repeats his
request, perhaps we may attend to it.’ On March 31 (Round Table No. <span class='fss'>XXXIV.</span>)
Hazlitt brings forward his proofs in a long paper which consists chiefly of extracts
from Locke, Hobbes and other philosophers. The essay begins as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘We have been required to give proof of Mr. Locke’s want of originality as a
metaphysical reasoner, and of the claims of Hobbes to be considered as the founder
of the modern system of the philosophy of the human mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Here then it is. But at the same time we would observe, that we do not
think ourselves bound to give this proof to those who have demanded it (somewhat
impatiently) at our hands. It was sufficient for us to have stated our
opinion on this subject, and to have referred the curious expressly to the sources
from which they might satisfy themselves of the truth or hollowness of our
assertion. To our readers in general we owe some apology for alluding to such
subjects at all. But to the point.—We have said that the principles of the
modern school of metaphysics are all to be found, pure, entire, connected, and
explicitly stated, in the writings of Hobbes: that Mr. Locke borrowed the leading
principle of that philosophy from Hobbes, without understanding or without
admitting the system in general, concerning which he always seems to entertain
two opinions: that succeeding writers have followed up Mr. Locke’s general
principle into its legitimate consequences, and have arrived at exactly the same
conclusions as Hobbes, but that being ignorant of the name and writings of
Hobbes, they have with one accord and with great injustice attributed the merit
of the original discovery of that system to Mr. Locke, as having made the first
start, and having gone further in it than any one else before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The principles of the modern system, of which Mr. Locke is the reputed and
Mr. Hobbes the real founder, are chiefly the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That all our ideas are derived from external objects, by means of the senses
alone, and are merely repetitions of our sensible impressions.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That as nothing exists out of the mind but matter and motion, so the mind
itself, with all its operations, is nothing but matter and motion.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That thoughts are single, or that we can have only one idea at a time; in
other words, that there are no complex ideas in the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That we have no general or abstract ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. That the only principle of connection between one idea and another is <em>association</em>,
or their previous connection in sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. That reason and understanding are resolvable entirely into the mechanism
of language.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. and 8. That the sense of pleasure and pain is the sole spring of action, and
self-interest the source of all our affections.</p>

<p class='c007'>9. That the mind acts from necessity, and consequently is not a moral or
accountable agent.</p>

<p class='c007'>[<em>The manner of stating and reasoning on this last point, viz. the moral and practical
consequences of the doctrine of necessity is the only circumstance of importance, in which
the modern philosophers differ from Hobbes.</em>]</p>

<p class='c007'>10. That there is no such thing as genius, or a difference in the natural
capacities or dispositions of men, the mind being originally alike passive to all
impressions, and becoming whatever it is from circumstances &#38;c., &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>‘That these are the most striking positions of the moderns with respect to the
human mind, is what every one, familiar with the writers since Locke, as
Berkeley, Hartley, Hume, Priestley, Horne Tooke, Beddoes, among ourselves, and
Helvetius, Condillac, Mirabaud, Condorcet &#38;c., among the French, will readily
allow: that most of them are to be found in the <cite>Essay on Human Understanding</cite>,
mixed up in a state of inextricable confusion with common-place and common sense
notions, now advanced, now retracted, the arguments on one side of the
question now prevailing through an endless labyrinth of explanation, now those on
the other, and now both opinions asserted and denied in the same sentence is
what is equally well known to the readers of Locke and his commentators. That
the same system came from the mind of Hobbes, not hesitating, stammering,
puling, drivelling, ricketty, a sickly half birth, to be brought up by hand, to be
nursed and dandled into common life and existence, but just the reverse of all this,
full grown, completely proportioned and articulated, compact, stamped in all its
lineaments, with the vigour and decision of the author’s mind, is what we have
now to shew.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The extracts follow, interspersed with brief comments by Hazlitt, and the essay
concludes as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘To what Mr. Hobbes has written on this subject [Liberty and Necessity]
nothing has been added nor can be taken away. We agree to every word of it,
and the more heartily, because it is the only one of all the points which have been
stated on which we do. In speaking of the popular notions of liberty, in his controversy
with a foolish Bishop of that day (Bramhall), he says, “In fine, that
freedom which men commonly find in books, that which the poets chaunt in the
theatres, and the shepherds on the mountains, that which the pastors teach in the
churches, and the doctors in the universities, and that which the common people
in the markets, and all mankind in the whole world do assent unto, is the same
that I assent unto, namely, that a man hath freedom to do if he will; but
whether he hath freedom to will, is a question which it seems neither the Bishop
nor they ever thought on.” Hobbes was as superior to Locke as a writer, as he
was as a reasoner. He had great powers both of wit and imagination. In short
he was a great man, not because he was a great metaphysician, but he was a great
metaphysician because he was a great man.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘It has been thought, that the neglect into which Hobbes’s metaphysical speculations
have fallen was originally owing to the obloquy excited by the irreligious and
despotical tendency of his other writings. But in this he has also been unfairly
dealt with. Locke borrowed his fundamental ideas of government from him;
and there is not a word directly levelled at religion in any of his works. At least,
his aristocratical notions and his want of religion must have, in some measure,
balanced one another; and Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> had his picture hanging in his bed-room,
though the Bishops wished to have him burnt. The true reason of the fate which
this author’s writings met with was, that his views of things were too original and
comprehensive to be immediately understood, without passing through the hands
of several successive generations of commentators and interpreters. Ignorance of
another’s meaning is a sufficient cause of fear, and fear produces hatred: hence
arose the rancour and suspicion of his adversaries, who, to quote some fine lines of
Spenser,</p>

  <h3 class='c022'><em>COLERIDGE’S ‘CHRISTABEL’</em></h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>On June 2, 1816, <cite>The Examiner</cite> published a review of Coleridge’s <cite>Christabel</cite>, as
to the authorship of which there has been some discussion. See <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>,
9th Ser. <span class='fss'>XI.</span> pp. 171 and 271. Mr. Dykes Campbell (<cite>The Poetical Works of Samuel
Taylor Coleridge</cite>, p. 606) is disposed to attribute the review to Hazlitt. As in the
case of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> notice of <cite>Christabel</cite> (see vol. <span class='fss'>X.</span> of the present
edition, pp. 411–418), Hazlitt’s authorship cannot be regarded as absolutely
certain. The review is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The fault of Mr. Coleridge is, that he comes to no conclusion. He is a man
of that universality of genius, that his mind hangs suspended between poetry and
prose, truth and falsehood, and an infinity of other things, and from an excess of
capacity, he does little or nothing. Here are two unfinished poems, and a
fragment. <cite>Christabel</cite>, which has been much read and admired in manuscript, is
now for the first time confided to the public. The <cite>Vision of Kubla Khan</cite> still
remains a profound secret; for only a few lines of it ever were written.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c009'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>‘The poem of <cite>Christabel</cite> sets out in the following manner:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis the middle of night by the castle clock,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the owls have awaken’d the crowing cock;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tu—whit! Tu—whoo!</div>
      <div class='line'>And hark, again! the crowing cock,</div>
      <div class='line'>How drowsily it crew.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir Leoline, the Baron rich,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath a toothless mastiff bitch;</div>
      <div class='line'>From her kennel beneath the rock</div>
      <div class='line'>She makes answer to the clock,</div>
      <div class='line'>Four for the quarters and twelve for the hour;</div>
      <div class='line'>Ever and aye, moonshine or shower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sixteen short howls, not over loud;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some say, she sees my lady’s shroud.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘We wonder that Mr. Murray, who has an eye for things, should suffer this
“mastiff bitch” to come into his shop. Is she a sort of Cerberus to fright away
the critics? But—gentlemen, she is toothless.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘There is a dishonesty as well as affectation in all this. The secret of this
pretended contempt for the opinion of the public, is that it is a sorry subterfuge
for our self-love. The poet, uncertain of the approbation of his readers, thinks he
shews his superiority to it by shocking their feelings at the outset, as a clown,
who is at a loss how to behave himself, begins by affronting the company. This
is what is called <em>throwing a crust to the critics</em>. If the beauties of <cite>Christabel</cite> should
not be sufficiently admired, Mr. Coleridge may lay it all to two lines which
he had too much manliness to omit in complaisance to the bad taste of his
contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘We the rather wonder at this bold proceeding in the author, as his courage
has cooled in the course of the publication, and he has omitted, from mere
delicacy, a line which is absolutely necessary to the understanding the whole
story. The <em>Lady Christabel</em>, wandering in the forest by moonlight, meets a lady
in apparently great distress, to whom she offers her assistance and protection, and
takes her home with her to her own chamber. This woman,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>——“beautiful to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a lady of a far countree,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>is a witch. Who she is else, what her business is with <cite>Christabel</cite>, upon what
motives, to what end her sorceries are to work, does not appear at present; but
this much we know, that she is a witch, and that <em>Christabel’s</em> dread of her arises
from her discovering this circumstance, which is told in a single line, which line,
from an exquisite refinement in efficiency,<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c009'><sup>[75]</sup></a> is here omitted. When the unknown
lady gets to <em>Christabel’s</em> chamber, and is going to undress, it is said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then drawing in her breath aloud</div>
      <div class='line'>Like one that shuddered, she unbound</div>
      <div class='line'>The cincture from beneath her breast:</div>
      <div class='line'>Her silken robe and inner vest</div>
      <div class='line'>Dropt to her feet, and full in view</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Behold! her bosom and half her side</em>—</div>
      <div class='line'>A sight to dream of, not to tell!</div>
      <div class='line'>And she is to sleep by Christabel!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘The manuscript runs thus, or nearly thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Behold her bosom and half her side—</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Hideous, deformed, and pale of hue</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘This line is necessary to make common sense of the first and second part.
“It is the keystone that makes up the arch.”<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c009'><sup>[76]</sup></a> For that reason Mr. Coleridge
left it out. Now this is a greater physiological curiosity than even the fragment
of <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘In parts of <cite>Christabel</cite> there is a great deal of beauty, both of thought, imagery,
and versification; but the effect of the general story is dim, obscure, and visionary.
It is more like a dream than a reality. The mind, in reading it, is spell-bound.
The sorceress seems to act without power—Christabel to yield without resistance.
The faculties are thrown into a state of metaphysical suspense and theoretical
imbecility. The poet, like the witch in <cite>Spenser</cite>, is evidently</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Busied about some wicked gin.”<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c009'><sup>[77]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But we do not foresee what he will make of it. There is something disgusting at
the bottom of his subject, which is but ill glossed over by a veil of Della Cruscan
sentiment and fine writing—like moon-beams playing on a charnel-house, or
flowers strewed on a dead body. Mr. Coleridge’s style is essentially superficial,
pretty, ornamental, and he has forced it into the service of a story which is
petrific. In the midst of moonlight, and fluttering ringlets, and flitting clouds,
and enchanted echoes, and airy abstractions of all sorts, there is one genuine
outburst of humanity, worthy of the author, when no dream oppresses him, no
spell binds him. We give the passage entire:—’</p>

<p class='c007'>[Here follow ll. 403–430 of <cite>Christabel</cite>, beginning ‘But when he heard the
lady’s tale.’]</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Why does not Mr. Coleridge always write in this manner, that we might
always read him? The description of the Dream of Bracy the bard, is also very
beautiful and full of power.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘The conclusion of the second part of <cite>Christabel</cite>, about “the little limber elf,”
is to us absolutely incomprehensible. <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>, we think, only shews that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>Mr. Coleridge can write better <em>nonsense</em> verses than any man in England. It is
not a poem, but a musical composition.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A damsel with a dulcimer</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>‘We could repeat these lines to ourselves not the less often for not knowing
the meaning of them.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In a sketch of Coleridge which appeared in <cite>The Examiner</cite> for Oct. 21, 1821,
Leigh Hunt quotes the lines from <cite>Kubla Khan</cite> (‘A damsel with a dulcimer,’
etc.) and says: ‘We could repeat such verses&#160;... down a green glade, a whole
summer’s morning’; but in spite of this and a few other verbal similarities, a
comparison of the sketch with the review does not support the theory that the
latter was written by Leigh Hunt. Possibly he wrote a few lines here and there,
but the review as a whole is far more suggestive of Hazlitt.</p>

is not given, is made the text for a most unflattering review of the characters of a
number of kings, from Hugh Capet to Louis <span class='fss'>XVI.</span> The subject would naturally
attract Hazlitt, and indeed it may be said that the essays are almost certainly his.

<p class='c023'>This and the eleven following papers from <cite>The Examiner</cite> of 1828 have been included
in the text mainly on account of the strong internal evidence they bear of
Hazlitt’s authorship. One of the papers is signed ‘W. H.,’ the rest are
unsigned. During the period covered by these essays other <cite>Theatrical Examiners</cite>
appeared, signed ‘X’ or ‘Q.’ So far as the editors are aware, it has not been
hitherto known that Hazlitt resumed regular theatrical criticism so late as 1828,

these twelve essays.</p>

    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘I said I never heard him speak with enthusiasm of any painter or work of merit, nor show 
    any love of art, except as a puffing-machine for him to get up into to blow a trumpet in 
    his own praise. Instead of falling down and worshipping such names as Raphael and Michael 
    Angelo, he is only considering how he may, by storm or stratagem, place himself beside 
    them, on the loftiest seats of Parnassus, as ignorant country squires affect to sit with 
    judges on the bench. He told me he had had a letter from Wilkie, dated Rome, with three 
    marks of admiration, and that he had dated his answer “Babylon the Great,” with four 
    marks of admiration. Stuff! Why must he always “out-Herod Herod?”<a id='r79'></a><a 
    href='#f79' class='c009'><sup>[79]</sup></a> Why must the place where 
    he is always have one note of admiration more than any other? He gave as his reasons, 
    indeed, our river, our bridges, the Cartoons, and the Elgin Marbles—the two last of 
    which, however, are not our own. H. should have been the boatswain of a man-of-war: he 
    has no other ideas of glory than those which belong to a naval victory, or to vulgar 
    noise and insolence; not at all as something in which the whole world may participate 
    alike. I hate “this stamp exclusive and professional.”<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' 
    class='c009'><sup>[80]</sup></a> He added that Wilkie gave a poor 
    account of Rome, and seemed, on the whole, disappointed. He (Haydon) should not be 
    disappointed when he went, for his expectations were but moderate. “Ay,” said Northcote, 
    “that is like the speech of a little, crooked, conceited painter of the name of Edwards, 
    who went to Italy with Romney and Humphreys, and when they looked round the Vatican, he 
    turned round to Romney and said, ‘Egad, George, we’re bit.’”
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>‘I said that when I heard stories of this kind, of even clever men who seemed to have no 
    idea or to take no interest except in what they themselves could do, it almost inclined 
    me to be of Peter Pindar’s opinion, who pretended to prefer taste to genius: “Give me,” 
    said he, “one man of taste, and I will find you twenty men of genius.” N. replied, “It is 
    a pity you should be of that opinion, for all your acquaintances are great geniuses; and 
    yet, I fancy, they have no admiration for anybody but themselves.’”

<p class='c023'>Hazlitt was for a time a fairly frequent contributor to <cite>The Edinburgh Magazine</cite>
(New Series), otherwise known as <cite>The New Scots Magazine</cite>. Two of his contributions,
‘Remarks on Mr. West’s Picture of Death on the Pale Horse,’ and ‘On
the Ignorance of the Learned,’ have been published in vols. <span class='fss'>IX.</span> and <span class='fss'>VI.</span> respectively.
The essays ‘On Fashion,’ ‘On Nicknames’ and ‘Thoughts on Taste’ in
the present volume were first reprinted with omissions and variations in <cite>Sketches
and Essays</cite> (1839); those ‘On the Question whether Pope was a Poet,’ (signed
W. H.), and ‘On Respectable People,’ are now reprinted for the first time.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>[HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE]</h3>

<p class='c023'>(1) Two letters from Hazlitt under the heading ‘Historical Illustrations of
Shakespeare’ appeared in the number for January 1819 (vol. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 39) and
ran as follows: ‘Mr. Editor, I daresay you will agree with me in thinking,
that whatever throws light on the dramatic productions of Shakespeare, deserves
to be made public. I have already, in the volume called <cite>Characters of Shakespeare’s
Plays</cite>,<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c009'><sup>[81]</sup></a> shewn, by a reference to the passages in North’s translation of Plutarch,
his obligations to the historian in his Coriolanus, and the noble way in which he
availed himself of the lights of antiquity in composing that piece. I shall, with
your permission, pursue the subject in the present and some future articles. The
parallel is even more striking between the celebrated trial-scene in Henry VIII.,
and the following narrative of that event, as it actually took place, which is to be
found in Cavendish’s Negociations of Cardinal Wolsey,’ [a long quotation from
that work follows, and Hazlitt concludes]: ‘In another article I shall give some
remarks on this subject, and the passages in Holingshed on which Macbeth is, in
a great measure, founded. I am, Sir, your humble servant, W. Hazlitt. London,
Nov. 13, 1818.’ Another letter on the same subject appeared in September 1819
(vol. <span class='fss'>V.</span> p. 262): ‘Mr. Editor, The following passage in North’s translation of
Plutarch will be found to have been closely copied in the scene between Brutus
and his wife in Julius Cæsar’ [a long quotation from Plutarch—see Temple
Classics edition, vol. <span class='fss'>IX.</span> pp. 256–258—follows, and Hazlitt continues]: Again, the
following curious account, extracted from Magellan’s Voyage to the South Seas,
may throw light on the origin of the Tempest, and the character of Caliban. The
mention of the god Setebos seems decisive of the identity of the source from
which he borrowed.’ The letter concludes with an extract from Magellan’s
Voyage.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>ON THE PRESENT STATE OF PARLIAMENTARY ELOQUENCE</h3>

<p class='c023'>Many of Hazlitt’s numerous contributions to <cite>The London Magazine</cite> have been
included in former volumes of the present edition. Of those printed in this
volume, the essay ‘On the Spirit of Partisanship’ was reprinted in <cite>Sketches and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>Essays</cite> (1839), that ‘On Consistency of Opinion’ in <cite>Winterslow</cite> (1850). The
remaining five are now republished for the first time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some interesting particulars about <cite>The London Magazine</cite> will be found in Mr.
Bertram Dobell’s <cite>Sidelights on Charles Lamb</cite> (1903).</p>

<p class='c007'>The essay ‘On the Present State of Parliamentary Eloquence’ is signed ‘T.’
and is No. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> of the series entitled ‘Table Talk.’ Cf. the Bibliographical and
Critical Notes to <cite>The Eloquence of the British Senate</cite>, vol. <span class='fss'>III.</span> p. 389, to which this
essay may be regarded as supplementary. Hazlitt had been a parliamentary
reporter on <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> in 1813. The exact period does not seem to be
ascertainable, but the present essay shows that he heard Plunket’s great speech on
Catholic Emancipation (Feb. 25, 1813), and Sir James Mackintosh’s maiden
speech (Dec. 14, 1813). With regard to Plunket’s speech there is a tradition that
Hazlitt was so fascinated by it that he omitted to take any notes of it. See
<cite>Memoirs, etc.</cite> (1867), <span class='fss'>I.</span> 196. Most of the speakers here described are referred to
more than once by Hazlitt elsewhere.</p>

<h3 class='c022'>[MR. CRABBE]</h3>

<p class='c023'>To <cite>The London Magazine</cite> for May 1821, Hazlitt contributed an essay on Crabbe,
under the heading ‘Living Authors, No. <span class='fss'>V.</span>’ The greater part of this essay was
republished in <cite>The Spirit of the Age</cite> (see vol. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> pp. 348 <i><span lang="la">et seq.</span></i>), but some passages
were omitted which are here supplied.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Magazine the first paragraph (which differs to some extent from the
opening of the <cite>Spirit of the Age</cite> essay) runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c024'>‘The object of Mr. Crabbe’s writings seems to be, to show what an
unpoetical world we live in: or rather, perhaps, the very reverse of this
conclusion might be drawn from them; for it might be said, that if this is
poetry, there is nothing but poetry in the world. Our author’s style might
be cited as an answer to Audrey’s inquiry, “Is poetry a true thing?” If
the most feigning poetry is the truest, Mr. Crabbe is of all poets the least
poetical. There are here no ornaments, no flights of fancy, no illusions of
sentiment, no tinsel of words. His song is one sad reality, one unraised,
unvaried note of unavailing woe. Literal fidelity serves him in the place
of invention; he assumes importance by a number of petty details; he
rivets attention by being prolix. He not only deals in incessant matters of
fact, but in matters of fact of the most familiar, the least animating, and
most unpleasant kind; but he relies for the effect of novelty on the microscopic
minuteness with which he dissects the most trivial objects—and, for
the interest he excites on the unshrinking determination with which he
handles the most painful. His poetry has an official and professional air.
He is called out to cases of difficult births, of fractured limbs, or breaches
of the peace; and makes out a parish register of accidents and offences.
He takes the most trite, the most gross and obvious, and revolting part of
nature, for the subject of his elaborate descriptions; but it is nature still,
and Nature is a great and mighty goddess. “Great is Diana of the
Ephesians.”<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c009'><sup>[82]</sup></a> It is well for the reverend author that it is so. Individuality
is, in his theory, the only definition of poetry. Whatever is, he hitches
into rhyme. Whoever makes an exact image of any thing on the earth
below, however deformed or insignificant, according to him, must succeed
and he has succeeded. Mr. Crabbe is one of the most popular and admired
of our living writers. That he is so, can be accounted for on no other
principle than the strong ties that bind us to the world about us and our
involuntary yearnings after whatever in any manner powerfully and directly
reminds us of it. His Muse is not one of the daughters of Memory, but
the old toothless mumbling dame herself, doling out the gossip and scandal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>of the neighbourhood, recounting, <i><span lang="la">totidem verbis et literis</span></i>, what happens in
every place in the kingdom every hour in the year, and fastening always
on the worst as the most palatable morsels. But she is a circumstantial
old lady, communicative, scrupulous, leaving nothing to the imagination,
harping on the smallest grievances, a village oracle and critic, most veritable,
most identical, bringing us acquainted with persons and things just as
they happened, and giving us a local interest in all she knows and tells.
The springs of Helicon are, in general, supposed to be a living stream,
bubbling and sparkling, and making sweet music as it flows; but Mr.
Crabbe’s fountain of the Muses is a stagnant pool, dull, motionless, choked
up with weeds and corruption; it reflects no light from heaven, it emits no
cheerful sound:—his Pegasus has not floating wings, but feet, cloven feet
that scorn the low ground they tread upon;—no flowers of love, of hope,
or joy spring here, or they bloom only to wither in a moment; our poet’s
verse does not put a spirit of youth in every thing, but a spirit of fear,
despondency and decay; it is not an electric spark to kindle and expand,
but acts like the torpedo touch to deaden and contract: it lends no rainbow
tints to fancy, it aids no soothing feelings in the heart; it gladdens no
prospect, it stirs no wish; in its view the current of life runs slow, dull,
cold, dispirited, half-underground, muddy, and clogged with all creeping
things. The world is one vast infirmary; the hill of Parnassus is a penitentiary;
to read him is a penance; yet we read on! Mr. Crabbe is a
<em>fascinating</em> writer. He contrives to “turn diseases to commodities,” and
makes a virtue of necessity. He puts us out of conceit with this world,
which perhaps a severe divine should do; yet does not, as a charitable
divine ought, point to another. His morbid feelings droop and cling to the
earth; grovel, where they should soar; and throw a dead weight on every
aspiration of the soul after the good or beautiful. By degrees, we submit
and are reconciled to our fate, like patients to a physician, or prisoners in
the condemned cell. We can only explain this by saying, as we said before,
that Mr. Crabbe gives us one part of nature, the mean, the little, the disgusting,
the distressing; that he does this thoroughly, with the hand of a
master; and we forgive all the rest!’—</p>

<p class='c007'>The essay then proceeds as in <cite>The Spirit of the Age</cite>, with a few trifling variations,
down to the words ‘inscribed to the Rutland family!’ (vol. <span class='fss'>IV.</span> p. 351, last
line), after which there is the following long passage, omitted from that work [the
quotations are indicated in brackets]:</p>

<p class='c024'>‘But enough of this; and to our task of quotation.’ The poem of <cite>The
Village</cite> sets off nearly as follows:</p>

<p class='c024'>‘“No; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,” etc. [<cite>The Village</cite>, i. 49–62].</p>

<p class='c024'>‘This plea, we would remark by the way, is more plausible than satisfactory.
By associating pleasing ideas with the poor, we incline the rich to
extend their good offices to them. The cottage twined round with real
myrtles, or with the poet’s wreath, will invite the hand of kindly assistance
sooner than Mr. Crabbe’s “ruin’d shed”; for though unusual, unexpected
distress excites compassion, that which is uniform and remediless produces
nothing but disgust and indifference. Repulsive objects (or those which
are painted so) do not conciliate affection, or soften the heart.’</p>

<p class='c024'>‘“Lo! where the heath with withering brake grown o’er,” etc. [<cite>The
Village</cite>, i. 63–84].<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c009'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>‘This is a specimen of Mr. Crabbe’s taste in landscape-painting, of the
power, the accuracy, and the hardness of his pencil. If this were merely a
spot upon the canvas, which might act as a foil to more luxuriant and
happier scenes, it would be well. But our valetudinarian “travels from
Dan to Beersheba, and cries it is all barren.” Or if he lights “in a favouring
hour” on some more favoured spot, where plenty smiles around, he
then turns his hand to his human figures, and the balance of the account is
still very much against Providence, and the blessings of the English Constitution.
Let us see.</p>

<p class='c024'>‘“But these are scenes where Nature’s niggard hand,” etc. [<cite>The Village</cite>,
<span class='fss'>I.</span> 131–153.]<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c009'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>‘Grant all this to be true; nay, let it be told, but not told in “mincing
poetry.”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c009'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Next comes the <span class='sc'>Workhouse</span>, and this, it must be owned, is a
master-piece of description, and the climax of the author’s inverted system
of rural optimism.</p>

<p class='c024'>‘“Thus groan the Old, till by disease opprest,” etc. [<cite>The Village</cite>, <span class='fss'>I.</span>
226 to the end of Book I.]<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c009'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c024'>‘To put our taste in poetry, and the fairness of our opinion of Mr.
Crabbe’s in particular, to the test at once, we will confess, that we think
the two lines we have marked in italics:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘“Him now they follow to his grave, and stand</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>worth nearly all the rest of his verses put together, and an unanswerable
condemnation of their general tendency and spirit. It is images, such as
these, that the polished mirror of the poet’s mind ought chiefly to convey;
that cast their soothing, startling reflection over the length of human life,
and grace with their amiable innocence its closing scenes; while its less
alluring and more sombre tints sink in, and are lost in an absorbent ground
of unrelieved prose. Poetry should be the handmaid of the imagination,
and the foster-nurse of pleasure and beauty: Mr. Crabbe’s Muse is a determined
enemy to the imagination, and a spy on nature.</p>

<p class='c024'>‘Before we proceed, we shall just mark a few of those quaintnesses of
expression, by which our descriptive poet has endeavoured to vary his

<p class='c024'>‘As an instance of the <i><span lang="la">curiosa felicitas</span></i> in descriptive allusion (among
many others) take the following. Our author, referring to the names of
the genteeler couples, written in the parish register, thus “morals” on the
circumstance:</p>

<p class='c024'>‘“How fair these names, how much unlike they look,” etc. [<cite>The Parish
Register</cite>, <span class='fss'>II.</span> 283–300.]</p>

<p class='c024'>‘The <cite>Library</cite> and the <cite>Newspaper</cite>, in the same volume, are heavy and
common-place. Mr. Crabbe merely sermonises in his didactic poetry. He
must pierce below the surface to get at his genuine vein. He is properly
himself only in the petty and the painful. The <cite>Birth of Flattery</cite> is a
homely, incondite lay. The author is no more like Spenser than he is like
Pope. The ballad of Sir Eustace Grey is a production of great power and
genius. The poet, in treating of the wanderings of a maniac, has given a
loose to his conception of imaginary and preternatural evils. But they are of
a sort that chill, rather than melt the mind; they repel instead of haunting
it. They might be said to be square, portable horrors, physical, external,
not shadowy, not malleable; they do not arise out of any passion in the
mind of the sufferer, nor touch the reader with involuntary sympathy.
Beds of ice, seas of fire, shaking bogs, and fields of snow, are disagreeable
matters of fact; and though their contact has a powerful effect on the
senses, we soon shake them off in fancy. Let any one compare this fictitious
legend with the unadorned, unvarnished tale of Peter Grimes, and he
will see in what Mr. Crabbe’s characteristic strength lies. He is a most
potent copyist of actual nature, though not otherwise a great poet. In the
case of Sir Eustace, he cannot conjure up any phantoms from a disordered
imagination; but he makes honest Peter, the fisherman of the Borough,
see visions in the mud where he had drowned his ’prentice boys, that are as
ghastly and bewitching as any mermaid. We cannot resist giving the scene
of this striking story, which is in our author’s exclusive manner. “Within
that circle none durst walk but he.”<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c009'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The passage in Locke is as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>‘If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand, consists quickness of
parts, in this of having them unconfused and being able nicely to distinguish one
thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists in a great
measure the exactness of judgment and clearness of reason, which is to be observed
in one man above another. And hence perhaps may be given some reason of that
common observation that men who have a great deal of wit and prompt memories,
have not always the clearest judgment, or deepest reason. For wit lying most in
the assemblage of ideas, and putting them together with quickness and variety,
wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to make up pleasant
pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; judgment on the contrary lies quite
on the other side, in separating carefully one from another ideas wherein can be
found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by similitude and by
affinity to take one thing for another.’—<cite>Locke’s Essay</cite>, vol. i. p. 143.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. This relates to what Mr. Locke says of unity, whom all succeeding writers
have made a point of bringing forward on all occasions, merely for the purpose of
differing from him. They set him up as the standard, or <i><span lang="fr">ne plus ultra</span></i> of profound
wisdom, and yet they always contrive to go beyond him. I will just add, by the
bye, on this argument about number, that the fair way of putting it is by asking
whether one combination of ideas is not different from another, or whether one
foot or one inch is the same with thirty-six feet, or thirty-six inches, not whether
one foot is the same as thirty-six inches. Otherwise there will remain a real
distinction of number, both in idea and in fact.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. The two men of the greatest ability in modern times as metaphysicians, that
is, with the greatest power of seeing things in the abstract, and of pursuing a
principle into all its consequences, are in my opinion Hobbes and Berkeley: after
them come Hume and Hartley. Compared with these Locke was a mere common
practical man: of the four, I think Hobbes was at the head, as the others only
worked out the materials with which he furnished them.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. This, if the translation is correct, is proving a great deal more than Leibnitz’s
restriction of Locke’s doctrine requires, and is, as it appears to me, the great
stumbling block in Kant’s Philosophy. It is quite enough to shew, not that there
are certain notions <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i> or independent of sensation, but certain faculties
independent of the senses or sensible objects, which are the intellect itself, and
necessary, after the objects are given, to form <em>ideas</em> of them. That is to say,
ideas are the result of the action of objects on such and such faculties of the
mind. Kant’s notions <i><span lang="fr">à priori</span></i>, seem little better than the innate ideas of the
schools, or the Platonic ideas or forms, which are to me the forms of <em>nothing</em>.
The sole and simple question is, whether there are not certain intellectual faculties
distinct from the senses, which exist before any ideas can be formed, as it is not
denied by any one, that there are certain sensitive faculties which must exist
before any sensations can be received. The one supposition no more implies
innate ideas, than the other implies innate sensations.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Now Kant, by thus classing, as he apparently does, the representations of
space and time as forms of the sensitive faculty, throws up the whole argument:
for if these very complex (not to say distracted) ideas, can be referred to mere
sensation, I do not see why all the rest may not. Time is obviously an idea of
succession or memory, and cannot be the result of an immediate sensible impression.
The only power of the sensitive faculty is to receive blind, unconscious,
unconnected impressions; the only category of the understanding is to perceive
the <em>relations between these impressions</em>, so as to connect them consciously together,
or to form ideas. To this category of relation, all the other general categories of
quantity, totality, cause and effect, etc. as well as the ideas of space and time, are
necessarily consequent and subordinate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. See to the same purpose Hobbes’s Human Nature, p. 25, and Leviathan, p.
14. Berkeley’s Principles of Human Knowledge, p. 15 and 24. Hume’s
Treatise, p. 46. Helvetius on the Mind, p. 10, and Condillac’s Logic, p. 54.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. ‘Lastly, that there is some one principle or substance, absolutely simple in its
nature, and distinct from every composition of matter, which is the seat of thought,
the soul of man, and the bond of our existence, will appear evident to any one who
considers the nature of judgment and comparison: where both terms of the one,
and both branches of the other must be apprehended together, in order to determine
between them. Let one man be ever so well acquainted with St. Peter’s at
Rome, and another with St. Paul’s in London, they can never tell which is the
larger, the handsomer, or make any other comparison between the two buildings
by virtue of this knowledge. But you will say, the one may communicate his
knowledge to the other: but then that other has the idea of both before him in
his imagination, and it is from this that he forms his judgment. Nor is the case
different with respect to the parts of a percipient being: let the idea of an elephant
be impressed upon particle <em>a</em>, and that of a mouse upon particle <em>b</em>, they can never
know either jointly or separately which is the larger creature: nor can a judgement
be formed till the ideas of both coincide in one and the same individual.
This is the common sense of mankind. For when we make use of the pronouns,
I, He, You, &#38;c. and say, <em>I heard such a sound</em>; <em>I saw such a sight; or felt such a
sensation</em>; are not these different impressions all referred by implication to the
same simple individual? Or were I to say, that in looking at a chess-board for
instance, one part of me saw the yellow king, another the black, another the
queen, another the bishop, and so on, should I not be laughed at by every body as
not knowing what I was talking about?’—Tucker’s Light of Nature pursued,
chapter on the Independent Existence of Mind. See also Rousseau’s reasoning in
Answer to Helvetius, Emile, tom. 3. And Bentley’s Sermons at the Boyle
Lecture.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. So little has this principle of the unity of thought and consciousness been understood,
that even Professor Stewart, the great champion of the intellectual philosophy,
utterly rejects it, and supposes that the idea which the mind forms of any visible
figure is nothing but a rapid succession of the ideas of the several parts. See his
reasoning on this subject most ably confuted in a work lately published, entitled
‘An Essay on Consciousness, by John Fearn.’—This Essay, in spite of the disadvantage
of the mechanical hypothesis with which it is encumbered, and the
technical obscurity of the style, contains, I think, more close and original observation
on the individual processes of the human mind, than any work published in
this country in the last fifty years.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The faces of N. Poussin want expression, as his figures want grace; but the
landscape part of his historical compositions was never surpassed. In his plague of
Athens the buildings seem stiff with horror. His Giants seated on the tops of
their fabled mountains, and playing on their Pan’s pipes are as natural and familiar
as ‘silly shepherds sitting in a row.’ The finest of his landscapes is his picture
of the Deluge. The sun is just seen wan and drooping in his course, the sky is
bowed down with a weight of waters, and heaven and earth seem commingling.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. The reader is referred to an elegant and beautiful description of Claude, in
Mr. Northcote’s Dream of a Painter.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. The idea of the necessity of tampering with nature, or giving what is called <em>a
flattering likeness</em>, was universal in this country fifty years ago. This would no
doubt be always easy, if the whole of the art consisted in leaving out, and not
putting in, what is to be found in nature. It may not be improper to add here,
that, in our opinion, Murillo is at the head of the class of painters, who have
treated subjects of common life. There is something in his pictures which is not
to be found at all in the productions of the Dutch school. After making the
colours on the canvass feel and think, the next best thing is to make them breathe
and live. But there is in Murillo’s pictures a look of real life, a cordial flow of
animal spirits, to be met with no where else. We might here particularly refer to
his picture of the <cite>Two Spanish Beggar-boys</cite> in Mr. Desenfans’ collection, which
cannot be forgotten by those who have ever seen it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. This theory will be found contained in Richardson’s Essay on Painting, and
in Coypel’s Discourses to the French Academy.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. This painter’s book of studies from nature, commonly called <cite>Liber Veritatis</cite>,
disproves the truth of Sir Joshua’s assumption, that his landscapes are mere
general compositions, for the finished pictures are nearly fac-similes of the original
sketches, and what is added to them in point of regularity (if this addition was any
advantage) was at least the result of his own genius.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. Sir Joshua considers it as a great disadvantage to Raphael in studying from
the antique, that he had not the facilities afforded by modern prints, but was
forced to seek out, and copy them one by one with great care. We should be
disposed to reverse this conclusion.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. The pictures of Rubens at Blenheim are another proof of this, and certainly
finer than the Luxembourg gallery.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. Michael Angelo took his ideas of painting from sculpture, and Sir Joshua from

<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. When the writer of this article was in France twelve years ago, a young
French artist began to copy in pencil a figure of the Virgin by Leonardo da Vinci.
He returned to it day after day, and week after week. He was always there.
He would first retouch an eyebrow or an eyelash, then do something to one of the
fingers, then mark in a bit of the drapery, and then return to the face again. All
this he did, sometimes leaning over the railing before the picture, sometimes sitting
on a stool, mechanically screwed on to it, sometimes standing on one leg. He
also relieved the monotony of his undertaking, by retiring to a small distance to
compare his copy with the original, or shewed it to some one near him, or went
round to look over others who were copying, or stood at the fire for an hour
together, or loitered into the sculpture room, or walked round the gallery, and
generally observed at his return that Poussin was excellent ‘pour la composition,’
Raphael ‘pour l’expression,’ Titian ‘pour les beaux coloris,’ but that David and
his pupils united all these qualities to the fine forms of the antique. At the end of
eleven weeks, we left him perfecting his copy. For anything we know, he may
be at it still.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. It is not correct to say that the French always colour from their casts. They
sometimes rouge them over with a beautiful rose-colour, or cover their lay-figures
with flesh-coloured Nankin, like that which adorns the bodies of their opera
dancers. We were at a loss to account for the colouring of David, till we heard
of this contrivance. It is thus that these accomplished persons think to rival the
hues of Titian and Correggio!</p>

make their way through the world without any one good quality. We have here

(says <cite>Don Quixote</cite> in defence of his attachment to <cite>Dulcinea</cite>, which however was
quite of the Platonic kind), ‘had cast the eyes of affection on a certain squat,
brawny lay brother of a neighbouring monastery, to whom she was lavish of her
favours. The head of the order remonstrated with her on this preference shown to
one whom he represented as a very low, ignorant fellow, and set forth the superior
pretensions of himself, and his more learned brethren. The lady having heard him

that in those points which I admire, Brother Chrysostom is as great a philosopher,

<p class='c007'>Losing gamesters act nearly on the same infatuated principle. Harrel, in <cite>Cecilia</cite>,

of Gray’s Bard. Gamesters and highwaymen are so far heroes that it is neck
or nothing with them: they set consequences at defiance. Their actions are
disinterested; but their motives are not so. A fortune-hunting General stands
much in the same predicament. The abstracted, the <em>ideal</em>, is necessary to the true
heroic. But before a man can fight for an idea, he must have an idea in his head
to fight for. Now there are some Generals that are not understood to possess
this qualification of the heroic character.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. We have said nothing here of the impiety of Mr. Canning’s parodies, though
a great deal has been said of the impiety of Mr. Hone’s, which unfortunately
happen to be on the other side of the question. It is true that <em>one man may steal a
horse sooner than another can look over a hedge</em>. Mr. Hone is not a Cabinet Minister,
and therefore is not allowed to take liberties with the Liturgy. It is to no purpose
to urge that Mr. Hone is a very good-natured man, that he is mild and inoffensive
in his manners, that he is utterly void of guile, with a great deal of sincere piety,
and that his greatest vice is that he is fond of a joke, and given to black-letter
reading. The answer is—‘But he has written parodies’—and it is to no purpose
to reply—So has Mr. Canning! He is a Cabinet Minister, and therefore incapable
of any thing vulgar or profane. One would think that the triumphant question
put by Mr. Hone to his Jury, ‘Whether Mr. Jekyll’s Parody on Black-eyed Susan
was meant to ridicule Sir William Curtis or the Ballad of Black-eyed Susan?’
would have put an end for ever to the cant on this subject, if reason could put an end
to cant on any subject. The fate of different men is curious. Mr. Canning, who
has all his life been defending the most odious and mischievous men and measures,
passes, on that very account, for a most amiable character and an accomplished
statesman. Mr. Hone, who defended himself against a charge of blasphemy for a
parody on the <cite>Church Service</cite> of which Mr. Canning had furnished him with
a precedent, rose from the attack by the force of good-nature, and by that noble
spirit of freedom and honesty in which to be unjustly accused is to be superior to
all fear, and to speak truth is to be eloquent—but that he did not suffer himself to
be crushed to atoms, and made a willing sacrifice to the prejudice, talent, and
authority arrayed against him, is a resistance to the opinions of the world and the
insolence of power, that can never be overlooked or forgiven.</p>

dowdy, and scarcely able to put one foot before another for very awkwardness and
shame, who but a week before she left home had perhaps trampled on a dress
brought home to her, in a fit of uncontrollable rage, thrown a cap into the fire, and
kicked her milliner down stairs for bringing her such unfashionable trumpery.
One would scarcely believe that a mere change of place would make such an

<p class='c007'>Now, Mr. Wordsworth’s poems, though not profane, yet neither are they sacred,
to deserve this solemn style, though some of his admirers have gone so far as to
compare them for primitive, patriarchal simplicity, to the historical parts of the
Bible. Much has been said of the merits and defects of this large poem, which is
‘portion of a larger;’—perhaps Horace’s rule has been a double bar to its success—<i><span lang="la">Non

beauty of her singing the lines in Artaxerxes, ‘What was my pride is now my
shame,’ &#38;c., in which the notes seem to fall from her lips like languid drops from
the bending flower, and her voice flutters and dies away with the expiring conflict
of passion in her bosom, may console himself with the possession of other faculties,

living artist (Mr. Alston), in the present exhibition of the Royal Academy. The
academic skill in it is admirable, and many of the forms are truly elegant and
beautiful; but I may be permitted to add, that the scene (as he represents it) too
much resembles the courtly designs of Vitruvius or Palladio, rather than ‘a temple
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens’; and that the angels seem rather
preparing to dance a minuet or grand ballet on the marble pavement which they
tread, than descending the air in a dream of love, of hope, and gratitude.</p>

Or was it on that occasion that Prince Tallyrand made his observation, ‘that
speech was given to man to conceal his thoughts’? I cannot agree with Mr.
Hobhouse in his compliment to the expression which Isabey has given to Lord
Castlereagh’s face in the <em>insulated</em> figure of him in the picture of the Congress.

of rain. Happy is he who has an umbrella, and can escape when the first fury of
the storm has abated. Turn this gateway into a broker’s shop, full of second-hand
furniture—tables, chairs, bedsteads, bolsters, and all the accommodations of
man’s life,—the case will not be mended. On the other hand, convert it into a
wild natural cave, and we may idle away whole hours in it, marking a streak in the
rock, or a flower that grows on the sides, without feeling time hang heavy
on us. The reason is, that where we are surrounded with the works of man—the
sympathy with the art and purposes of man, as it were, irritates our
own will, and makes us impatient of whatever interferes with it: while, on
the contrary, the presence of nature, of objects existing without our intervention
and controul, disarms the will of its restless activity, and disposes us to submit
to accidents that we cannot help, and the course of outward events, without
repining. We are thrown into the hands of nature, and become converts to her
power. Thus the idea of the artificial, the conventional, the voluntary, is fatal
to the romantic and imaginary. To us it seems, that the free spirit of nature
rushes through the soul, like a stream with a murmuring sound, the echo of which
is poetry.</p>
